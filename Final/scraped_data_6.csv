https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Assistant,Bot,2024-08,0,"While many software developers appreciate Agile methodologies for their flexibility and iterative approach, some express frustration for various reasons:
Misunderstanding of Agile Principles: Many organizations adopt Agile without fully understanding its principles, leading to a checkbox mentality rather than a genuine embrace of Agile values.
Increased Pressure: Agile often emphasizes rapid delivery and frequent iterations, which can lead to increased pressure on developers to meet tight deadlines, sometimes at the expense of quality.
Meetings and Ceremonies: Agile frameworks often include numerous meetings (like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives), which can feel excessive and time-consuming, detracting from actual development work.
Scope Creep: The flexibility of Agile can sometimes lead to scope creep, where requirements continuously change, making it challenging for developers to maintain focus and complete tasks.
Lack of Documentation: Agile promotes working software over comprehensive documentation, which can lead to difficulties in understanding the system later, especially for new team members or during maintenance.
Team Dynamics: Agile relies heavily on team collaboration and self-organization. In teams where members are not aligned or where there are conflicts, this can lead to frustration and inefficiency.
Management Misalignment: Sometimes, management may not support Agile practices effectively, leading to a disconnect between what developers are trying to achieve and what is expected from them.
Tooling and Infrastructure: Agile requires certain tools and infrastructure to support continuous integration and delivery. If these are lacking, it can hinder the Agile process and frustrate developers.
While Agile has its merits, these challenges can lead to discontent among developers, particularly if the methodology is not implemented thoughtfully."
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Arno Brevoort,designing and writing code has paid the bills for over 20 years,2017,90,"Agile done right, is the way a band of programmers would organize their work. Once everyone is on location, before you get into the thick of things, brew a pot of coffee and have a quick chat. How are you getting on, did you run into any trouble, what shall we do today. Help / advice is offered where necessary and you carry on with the day. The programmers are talking to each other and helping each other out. Work is done as a team.
Agile done wrong, is a micro-managers’ dream. You can instantly pick on “failing” programmers, harp on why things haven’t been done, blame people. Instead of a collaborative meeting to plan the day ahead, it turns into a daily “progress report”, a “triage”, or a “crisis planning meeting”. The sign of this is the programmers no longer talking to each other in the meeting, keeping their heads down, and “reporting” up the command chain to a “scrum master” / “project manager” who is no longer involved in actually writing code.
The first Agile is a fantastic way to work. The second “Agile” is hell on earth."

Here are a couple of examples:
Should we use RDB or NoSQL or combination of both? Ok, which implementation of those should be use? (Just examples…_) MongoDb + MySQL? How does Mongo handle our input or query needs. Hmmm, not very well. Why? Should we switch or tune?
What’s the best way to handle that data widget? Pre-process it once a day? Do it on the fly? Let’s pre-process every day at 4am. (Implement that but… by 4pm it’s too stale). Let’s re-implement it to do it on the fly. But we’ll need another server and interface for that.
How are we going to do auth/auth? What are the capabilities of that geo-spatial library? Does that API in XYZ allow us to do that? What’s a work around for that?
You get the picture. In scrum there’s supposed to be a story worked that you can demonstrate at the end of the sprint. Yeah, yeah, I’ve heard it all before about having stories to do these things. And that WOULD be fine if software dev professionals were running the show. I personally would have a story for each one of the above. The developer would then demonstrate / explain results at the end of the sprint to the team, NOBODY ELSE. But my Direct experience has been, as soon as one of these stories is in the backlog, along comes Joe Scrum Master or Product Owner or Manager and we start arguing about whether that’s a story. Here comes the time wasting nonsense - Can’t we work it into this or that? Or, what can we demo when that story is done because that’s the only way we show progress. You can’t demo THAT! It’s endless nonsense on the dogma that has become scrum.
There’s alot more wrong including how to handle defects flowing in from customers and previous iterations, how to refactor something, etc. I’ve heard the answers from scrum “professionals” and it’s like we’re trying to find the answer to a car question in a yoga manual, i.e. I’m fixing a headlight but that needs to be done in the downward dog position. Everything but the simple stories are unnatural.
Oh, and don’t forget the daily status meetings. Don’t even try to convince me they are Anything But. That’s what they are, that’s what they will always be. A way better way to handle that is a dev is supposed to have responsibility to report potential slippage. If somebody isn’t doing that - then THAT’s when a manager should pop their head in.
It’s a very unnatural, babysitting-like environment."

Scrum?
Kanban?
something else?
I really dislike Scrum and I am a Certified Scrum Master. Scrum will sooner or later end up with poor software. In ways, it is anti-agile because there are so many “processes”. The worst thing in my mind is the 2-week sprints. Programmers start out doing good work the first week of a 2-week spring, then start feeling the pressure to meet their sprint commitments and start rushing the work. Never ends well. What ends up happening is they pad the amount of time a task takes. So we spend time guessing at effort instead of doing the work.
Kanban, on the other hand, solves many of these problems, by removing some of the processes and working from a prioritized backlog (scrum does as well), but programmers take the highest priority task and work on it until done. No stand-ups, sprint planning, etc. Management hates it because they don’t ha...

SCRUM is not Agile, never was, never will be. It goes against the most important Agile principle, “People and Interactions over tools and process”
It might be a good methodology for some projects [it is!]. It is most certainly not the one and only good method for everything.
It often takes away the pleasure in work that used to be felt by many excellent programmers that for decades delivered good quality software without the help of SCRUM. That is enough to treat it with suspicion. And it is true of both “real” SCRUM and the cargo-cult variety.
I have never yet met a programmer that asked be part of a SCRUM team. So far as I can see it is always imposed from above by control freaks with the word “manager” or “director” in their job title, but with a complete lack of any ability to manage or capable only of directing in the wrong direction."

https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Jerry Westrick,CEO at Software House Merida (2016–present),2020,10,"Part one:
The “Agile Manifesto” which first coined the term “Agile”, starts off saying:
This is a study of some of the things that Small teams have used to achieve large results. Pick and use the things that work for you.
This is a far cry from “you have to …”, “You must …” as implemented in most companies.
Agile as I see it consists of workers who do undefined work using undefined methods. And a leader who’s sole purpose in life is to enable the workers.
Everything else is a big company trying to force structure and form on a process which was chosen because programming is so much faster without it.
Part Two:
I have seen many “agile projects” fail for the simple reason that the people ordering the software did not understand what was going on. If you are going to implement an “iterative” development process, please do yourself a favor and make sure your “Owners”, “Stake holders”, or “End Users” know exactly what they are doing.
I cannot tell you the number of times I have heard “Ready for Production” from the “End Users” when all major back end work is still “Simulated” by “End User” priorities. It is very difficult to keep your “End Users” expectations realistic when the screen looks perfect and seems to work."
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Gniewomir Świechowski,"Full-stack developer, occasionally tech lead",2021,6,"I can speak only for myself, but it may be representative for at least part of wider group of so-called “agile-hating developers” so I will be using plural. :)
We do not hate agile. We despise how companies are often smuggling waterfall under agile disguise.
Problem with current understanding of what agile is that people in charge often associate it with particular implementation. Scrum for example. They expect that we will religiously adhere to some arbitrary set of rules with disregard of them working or not for our use case - which is exact opposite of being agile and constantly looking for what works best!
At the same time, when you are “agile” - in aforementioned way, you are still expected to provide waterfall-like estimations for things months away, which you rarely can reason about - without being a prophet, as the same people will change their requirements multiple times, without giving you space for changing guesstimation, they forced you to make before.
It is even more problematic, as this kind of being “agile” is very popular in businesses outside tech sector (most of them!), which means that whatever they have is probably in state of disrepair, obscure for any reasoning about it and very, very fragile. Which makes even 2 week predictions about what we will be able to do at best unreliable and at worst pure fantasy. But don’t expect to be given much space to remediate this problem.
So “agile”(note quotes) lovers create teams that chase this arbitrary deadlines (re-implemented from waterfall) with disregard for technical debt, basic hygiene (understood as CI/CD, automated testing, developer experience, developing common language with business etc.) and quality (re-implemented from waterfall) but with shitload of often unproductive meetings (re-implemented from waterfall).
Teams that are as much “agile”, as the where 20-yrs ago, but more frustrated because all of the bullshit pretending around.
What we hate is when people grab sexy buzz-word and slap it on waterfall-like process without any understanding there are not many canned answers in this field.
To be truly agile everybody in organization have to accept, embrace this constant state of flux every business and every code base is in and act on it - implementing more iterative process, not cling to illusions of predictability under disguise of being “agile”.
We love being agile, we hate being “agile”."
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Joe Seabreeze,Programming for many years,2019,12,"Because it doesn’t work for every company/team for various reasons:
If you have bad project/product management from the start, Agile isn’t going to fix it. It will likely make things worse.
Some companies try to institute Agile practices even if their business model doesn’t require it.
Many managers don’t really understand what Agile is, so they’ll sometimes use it as a way to micro-manage. It’s easy to use an agile process for micro-management, which is a very stressful and unproductive way to manage a team.
It’s not easy for a service-oriented and reactive business to execute Agile development. How can a developer get anything done in a static sprint when they’re getting pulled into meetings and answering emails half the time? Basically, your development work slips every week, putting too much pressure on the developer.
If your business is highly regulated, it’s not easy to incorporate Agile development. Part of Agile is to reduce unnecessary documentation. With a highly regulated business, it’s all about documentation.
If your software platform has a large code base and doesn’t have a modular architecture, 2 week sprints are practically impossible. And once you start heading into one month sprints, well, Agile stops having any benefit.
If your whole organization doesn’t support Agile, then it will likely break down in the smaller teams that do. It’s not easy to work in Agile teams when your work environment as a whole isn’t agile.
The tagline for Agile at its inception was “For Developers”. In more cases than none, it has been the opposite. Poor Agile execution and micro-management puts way too much pressure on developers, so developers feel betrayed by a system that was suppose to be for them.
In the end, there are just way too many factors that can mess things up when using Agile. So it’s likely that low quality and emotional stress will outweigh any of the benefits that Agile is supposed to provide."

Answer: it depends on how you use it!
Currently: Scrum is anti-engineering.
Scrum like everything on earth is a powerful noble idea that capitalism took and turned into an evil monetisation tool, just like Christmas and Vegetarianism. The way it’s usually used, makes it nothing more than continues rapid prototyping while ignoring the technical debt, to generate your first sale and may be sell off the company, then the horrible code base becomes someone’s else problem. It is used by non-technical bosses to drive developers and work them to the bone. To micromanage everything and ask you to log every minute of your day. All the accumulated technical debt doesn’t matter because all you need is to show your feature to sell them. Then once you do, you blame the current heroic development team for the bugs and you replace them with others. It is used so your trade code monkey are driven to produce, while the engineering talent is suppressed. It pushes Devs to choose the fastest solution to implement, not the best solution, because who has time to research and implement that new library or framework that will make you future proof, when you can hammer out few lines now, then when a change comes along, you delete that crap and start from zero. Why try to abstract and code re-use, when you can simply copy-paste. Because when you over or under estimate your user story, management look at you as either a thief, or lazy, or both. Because when you try to object and raise concerns about being hampered by all the tracking and estimation, management says: light process is a privilege that you have to earn. And don’t blame the scrum master for being a management puppet that is only there to spy on the team because he is not trained, but we don’t have the budget for real scrum training. But we are scrum.
Others agree as well

Stats become more important than the code itself. We hate it for the reasons weak programmers love it.

We hate it because we dont like being told how to do our jobs and especially not by some SCRUM 'master' who most likely has never written a line of code in their life.

Order can be brought to chaos only temporarily. Anyone who hates on it probably is being forced to follow it at all times. Its good to have guidelines but rules are meant to be broken when the chaos is at a maximum. The secret that takes most 10+ years to learn is to avoid religous affinty to any one style or practice for anything to do with tech but be willing to borrow from any of it.
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Jeff,"developer, author: 5 books; Clean Code contributor; geek",2019,4,"As Robert Garrett suggests, it’s the specific implementations and trappings of agile—not the underlying values or principles themselves—that can be the problem. The values of agile might seem motherhood & apple pie, and most people wouldn’t dispute them. The principles have a bit more meat in terms of describing how to begin implementing agile. If you’re not familiar with them, take a few minutes to read them; most people similarly won’t disagree with much here.
Some examples of things that people think are “agile” but are specific to some implementation:
Stand-up meetings / daily scrums—perhaps the one thing that’s most universally botched. They are intended to be a quick touchpoint and plan for the day, but devolve into boring, glorified status meetings for many teams (mostly because most teams aren’t truly collaborating like agile says they should). There’s really no standard set of questions, but too many teams somehow have fallen into the “what’d you do yesterday, what are you doing today” rut.
Pair programming. Comes from XP. Many devs really hate this idea, though for those who aren’t vehemently averse to it, it can be enjoyable and highly productive.
Specific story format. “As a / I want to / so that…” A nice idea. Not an absolute must.
SAFe. A big bloated thing with lots of buzzwords. It might be beneficial to larger organizations with the need to coordinate many projects. Don’t do it unless you know you need it (and then, consider something else like LESS). Don’t do it until you’ve learned how to get at least one agile team to click, and really click well.
Agile implemented in a rote way involves lots of meetings—something we wanted to get away from 20 years ago when I learned about XP. The meetings ain’t the thing. I understand why the typical developer reaction is that it’s meeting heavy.
Further turning people away: The proliferation of the Agile Expert—sometimes a ScrumMaster—someone who’s learned all the basics & buzzwords, just enough to be dangerous, dogmatic, and annoying.
Agile can and does work very well, and in a way that’s enjoyable and not off-putting. And standup meetings, pair programming, story formats, and iteration planning meetings can all be valuable tools, particularly to a team new to agile. But learning how to make them effective and not onerous is also important, as is learning when something better is called for."
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,James Thayer,40 years of experience in software development.,2018,1,"“…the agile process…”
These three words sum up what I dislike…the idea that there is a singular process — or even a small number of processes that, if followed like a recipe, will magically give good results.
It just ain’t so. As Fred Brooks famously said “[There is] No Silver Bullet.” People and culture determine success. Process is merely a tool. And like all tools, process (whether agile or not) can be wielded in ways that are either constructive or destructive.
Now, that said, in today’s world, situations change rapidly and that means product requirements will change rapidly. For this reason, in most cases, lack of agility is not an option. To be successful, engineering organizations must be agile (at least to some degree.) The only question is how they achieve agility.
Fortunately, over the last three decades (or so), there is a pretty good record of techniques and strategies that have been successfully deployed to achieve agility. It is incumbent upon engineering leaders (both formal and informal) to be aware of this body of work so that they can draw upon this knowledge. There is no one-size-fits-all process that will work for every organization. Wise leaders will recognize what strategies and techniques will work for their organization and they will forge their own process that supports the successful delivery of products.
Never lose sight of the fact that “agile” is a means by which success is achieved. It is never the end goal itself."
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Bob MacNeal,Software Product Development (1989–present),2018,3,"We don’t…at least those of us who’ve been doing this for a while.
Agile has been a given on virtually any software team for a least a decade. But, like one’s political views, or one’s religious beliefs, one doesn’t wear one’s agility on their sleeve.
Seasoned developers simply have assimilated the relevant guidance from the agile manifesto, and it’s predecessor XP, and moved on.
If one behaves like a clue-challenged clown (e.g., referring to anything in the “Scrum Guide”, or mindlessly engaging in the gratuitous ceremonies of various “methods” as if anything in software could possibly be applicable to all situational contexts), seasoned developers will politely ignore you.
It’s not that seasoned developers dislike agile — I’ve yet to work with a developer who’d disagree with the guidance in the agile manifesto — it’s simply that there’s a whole industry of charlatans, mountebanks, and overpaid coaches who’ve sprung up around “the agile” that stokes our ire."

The problem is solves is one where the software never gets finished, doesn’t work, doesn’t meet the customer’s needs, etc. These are real problems in some organizations and Agile will definitely solve them.
The problem it creates is that it values code over design, and functionality over maintainability. The idea is to get it working and ship it out. Unfortunately, the real cost in software isn’t in the initial implementation but in the maintenance. If you don’t have a solid design and good design documentation then you’ll paint yourself into a corner is no time.

https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Dale N Reynolds,Studied Mathematics & Computer Science (Graduated 1965),2021,2,I know of no software developers who do not like agile much better than traditional. I know hundreds of software developers.
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Chuck Cobb,Agile Project Mgt Author and Instructor (Over 200K Students),2021,2,I don’t believe your supposition that “software developers hate Agile” is correct. There probably are some software developers who don’t like Agile because it imposes additional responsibilities and accountability on them beyond simply writing code. They have to take full responsibility for their own work and collaboratively work with a team of developers and business people to develop effective business solutions. Many developers see the increased responsibility and empowerment as very challenging and motivational bug some people just want to write code.

No.
and why?
Agile (lower case A) works in a large number of cases. As long as you do the most important part of it. Introspection and adaptation."
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Chuck Cobb,Agile Project Mgt Author and Instructor (Over 100K Students),2021,1,Probably because a lot of software developers just want to sit in their cubes with their headsets on listening to tunes and write code. Agile forces then to interact with other people and take on additional responsibilities beyond just coding.
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,John Baker,"MBA in Rady School of Management, UC San Diego, University of California, San Diego (Graduated 2004)",2018,1,"I do not hate agile methodology and here I listed some of the main benefits of it:
High product quality - in agile development, testing is integrated during the cycle, which means that there are regular checkups to see that the product is working during the development. This enables the product owner to make changes if needed and the team is aware if there are any issues.
Higher customer satisfaction - the product owner is always involved, the progress of development has high visibility and flexibility to change is highly important. This implies engagement and customer satisfaction.
Increased project control
Reduced risks
Faster ROI - the fact that agile development is iterative means that the features are delivered incrementally, therefore benefits are realized early while the product is in development process."
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Andy Wootton,Director at System Composition Ltd. (1985–present),2020,0,"“Agile” is an adjective that describes processes, not a single process. “The Manifesto of Agile Software Development” is a page of relative values that you can use as a metric against any process of your own choosing. Anyone who thinks they hate it, probably actually hates something else, like a poor process they’ve been told to follow."
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-software-developers-hate-Agile,Anatoly Spektor,"Founder of DefineAgile.com, Host of ""The Unusual Jobs Show""",2018,1,"I have a question on your question: Why would anyone hate agile process ?
I am a Software Engineer of 6 years, Scrum Master and Agile Coach. I move towards teaching Agile from being fascinated by the process by being a Developer.
There are times when people have their own flavour of Agile, which can not be appealing - but mindset of iterations, and producing software that is reliable - I don’t see what here not to like ?"
