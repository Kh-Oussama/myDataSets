https://www.quora.com/Whats-wrong-with-Agile-Scrum,Hariharan Narayanan,"CSM, PMP, Trainer and Agile Coach",2016,5,"Like others have answered so eloquently here, I would also say that there is inherently nothing wrong with Agile or Scrum. Let me list out the issues that I see mostly.
Equating Agile with Scrum with Agile. Agile is not just Scrum. Being Agile is having a certain mindset of going about doing product development. Scrum is just one way of doing it. Many tend to not make this distinction.
Scrum is not a silver bullet that magically solves everything. Scrum, like any other Agile method out there, facilitates bringing out the dirt. If you look carefully. all that the framework facilitates with all it’s ceremonies and roles is to hold a mirror to your development machine and surface issues as early as possible. Further improvement can be achieved only by honestly addressing those issues and following the method so that further issues can be identified and rectified. It does not help if one tends to blame the method for the problems found instead of addressing the problems.
Scrum needs a certain set of pre-conditions to be successful. The primary pre-condition is that the scope of work of a Sprint should not be disturbed during the Sprint. Typically, a Sprint is expected to last a minimum of 2 weeks for Scrum to be of any value. Now, I have seen some start-up teams where work moves and changes quite fast and keeping the scope constant for 2 weeks is nearly impossible. Yet, they want to practice Scrum. So they reduce the Sprint duration to 1-week (or sometimes even less). This is a sub-optimal way of using Scrum because the ceremonies and rituals of Scrum become a hindrance/overhead for very short Sprints. For such environments a much more lightweight Agile method needs to be used until such a time that the Scope is in enough control to stay constant for 2 weeks and then start Scrum.
The “there is only one way of managing product development and this is Scrum” fallacy. This complements the points given above in that some organizations have these experts whose only answer to anything related to Agile is Scrum. This attitude sometimes borders on zealotry. All projects can certainly get better with Agile methods, but not all projects need it. Within the projects that need it, not all projects need Scrum. Agile is not just Scrum and this attitude only exposes a misunderstanding of Agile and Scrum and their inability to take an empirical approach.
Fixation with every team doing Scrum in the exact same way. There is only one exact way of doing Scrum and this was designed by the inventors of Scrum. Even they recommended a rigorous adherence to the definitive method only for the first few iterations, after that teams are expected to empirically adapt the method to their realities. This should mean that every Scrum team is different and will have a slightly different method from other teams. It may so happen that many teams in an org will evolve a same pattern of their method over time. But many times I have seen organizations simply force-fit a fully-customized method, with “best-practices” and all, on all their teams all at once. This takes away the natural learning curve and adaptability of the team."
https://www.quora.com/Whats-wrong-with-Agile-Scrum,Elena Rybnyk,8y,2016,1,"To begin with, I have to say that Agile and Scrum are not the same things. Agile - it’s some kind of philosophy, the way you think. And Scrum - it’s a method of doing things.
As a BA I had a chance to use different methodologies (Waterfall, Scrum, Kanban, etc.), and I can’t say that one is better, than another, because they are so different. Even more: each of them is good only for some definite type of project. For example: when you’ve got a huge project, where development will take forever to do and your customer changes his mind about requirements 3 times a day, there is no way to complete it using Waterfall. On other hand, when the project is small and you had a chance to deal with similar projects lots of times, there is no reason to break it down into pieces and use Scrum."
https://www.quora.com/Whats-wrong-with-Agile-Scrum,Chuck Cobb,Agile Project Mgt Author and Instructor (Over 100K Students),2016,3,"There is nothing inherently wrong with Agile/Scrum. The concept behind it is very sound. The problems associated with it are involved in how it is implemented. Here are a few typical problems:
Many people are overly zealous about Agile/Scrum and see it as a solution to any possible problem you might have rather than being objective about its strengths and weaknesses. Saying ""Agile is better than Waterfall"" is like saying ""a car is better than a boat"" - it totally depends on the environment that you're in.
Many people also see a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between ""Agile"" and ""Waterfall"" and attempt to force-fit a project to one of those extremes rather than going in the other direction and fitting the methodology to the nature of the project. Sometimes it is necessary to blend an adaptive and plan-driven approach in the right proportions to fit the situation.
Agile/Scrum is meant to be adaptive to fit the approach to the situation but that requires a deeper understanding of the principles behind it. Many people are looking for a simple “cookbook” solution and do it mechanically by the book which is exactly the opposite of how it is intended to be implemented.

https://www.quora.com/Whats-wrong-with-Agile-Scrum,Assistant,Bot,2024-08,0,"Agile and Scrum have been widely adopted methodologies in software development and project management, but they are not without their criticisms and challenges. Here are some common issues associated with Agile and Scrum:
1. Misunderstanding of Principles
Surface-Level Adoption: Many teams adopt Agile practices superficially without fully understanding the underlying principles, leading to a ""checklist"" mentality rather than a true Agile mindset.
Agile as a Buzzword: Organizations may use Agile as a buzzword to promote a culture of rapid change without implementing the necessary cultural shifts.
2. Overemphasis on Meetings
Meeting Fatigue: Scrum rituals (daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives) can become burdensome if not managed effectively, leading to decreased productivity and engagement.
Time Consumption: Some teams spend too much time in meetings, detracting from actual development work.
3. Role Confusion
Inconsistent Roles: The roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team can sometimes be misunderstood or poorly executed, leading to confusion and inefficiencies.
Authority Issues: There can be conflicts regarding authority and decision-making, particularly if the Product Owner is not empowered to prioritize effectively.
4. Inflexibility in Practice
Rigid Implementation: Some teams may become too rigid in following Scrum practices, losing sight of the flexibility that Agile promotes.
Resistance to Change: Teams may struggle to adapt Scrum practices to fit their unique context, leading to frustration and inefficiency.
5. Scaling Challenges
Difficulty in Scaling: Implementing Agile or Scrum at scale can be challenging, especially in large organizations. Frameworks like SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) attempt to address this, but can introduce complexity.
Coordination Issues: As teams grow, coordinating between multiple Scrum teams can lead to misalignment and communication challenges.
6. Quality Concerns
Focus on Speed: The emphasis on delivering features quickly can sometimes lead to compromised quality if testing and quality assurance practices are not integrated effectively.
Technical Debt: Rapid iterations can result in accumulating technical debt if teams prioritize delivering features over maintaining code quality.
7. Customer Involvement
Inconsistent Customer Engagement: Agile methodologies rely on customer feedback, but if customers are not consistently involved, the product may not meet user needs.
Stakeholder Confusion: Different stakeholders may have conflicting priorities, making it difficult for the team to align on product direction.
8. Cultural Fit
Not Suitable for All Environments: Agile may not be the best fit for every organization or project type, particularly in highly regulated industries where strict documentation and processes are required.
Team Dynamics: The success of Agile largely depends on team dynamics and culture; poor team morale or collaboration can hinder Agile effectiveness.
Conclusion
While Agile and Scrum can significantly enhance productivity and responsiveness in software development, they require a deep understanding, commitment to principles, and cultural alignment to be truly effective. Organizations should be mindful of these challenges and continuously adapt their practices to fit their unique contexts."

https://www.quora.com/Whats-wrong-with-Agile-Scrum,Nick Kitchener,Almost two decades of software development and I love it.,2016,2,"IMO the biggest weakness in Agile/Scrum in cases where the product fits the methodology is the organizational culture and the customer factor.
It's not uncommon for the non technical aspect of an organization to be very uncomfortable with committing a significant amount of money and time without knowing up front exactly what they're getting into.
There are also quite significant customer demographics that have a low tolerance for change, and the training overhead is significant.
I find that technical people tend to focus on technical risk and forget that there are many other risk categories in business that need managing in such a way that one doesn't cause problems for the others."
https://www.quora.com/Whats-wrong-with-Agile-Scrum,Siranut,Lives in Earth,2021,0,"SCRUM tries to come up with a well-defined goal in 15 minutes for the day, then repeat this everyday.
Seriously?
Let me mention a quote from Einstein. (I found many variants of it on the internet, but they are similar to this.)
If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes defining the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.
SCRUM literally inverts this."

Not everything can be done bit by bit, iteration by iteration. UI design and UX need to be done for the whole project and evaluated almost waterfall like before you develop it.
If you apply agile to UI design and don’t do UX on the whole your UI can be clown pants - that is individual parts may make sense but the whole looks like a clown - incoherent and not fitting together.
Use common sense and agile is great. Try to pound every aspect of the development process into an iteration by iteration process and your project may turn into a circus."
https://www.quora.com/Whats-wrong-with-Agile-Scrum,Osama Asif,Chief Technology Officer at ENOU Labs (2017–present),2022,1,"Agile development is an approach to software development that involves breaking down a project into smaller, more manageable chunks and then working in close collaboration with the client or team members to achieve those goals. It's a great way to make sure you're on track and making progress toward your goals, but it can be difficult to implement in a way that works for everyone involved.
Let me give you some examples:
1) If you're working on a team of five people, you might find that the constant back-and-forth between each person gets kind of exhausting—especially if one person is always behind schedule and another person is always ahead of schedule!
2) The constant feedback loop can be stressful if your client doesn't have good communication skills or isn't clear about what they need from their end (which is often why they hire someone else in the first place).
3) There's also a chance that other members of your team will feel pigeonholed into certain roles (like design vs. development vs. management), which can cause some discord among employees who want more freedom in their work responsibilities.
