First of all, Agile is not a methodology, you should research Agile a little more or even look up what a methodology is.
Agile is a mindset, and you either hate it or love it, so I will answer your scale with -10. I really love Agile and Agile Frameworks when done well. I can understand that some people hate it. This usually is not because of Agile or the framework used. It usually is because a company has seen the advantages of Agile and forces it down the throat of their organization.
Nothing forced or done badly is good.
I have been advocating Agile since 2002 and spcifically Scrum since 2005/6 and have seen companies transform into wonderful Agile organizations. I have also seen things go horribly wrong. Usually because bosses want the advantages of Agile without committing to the values and mindset.
Agile is done best when done thoroughly and with the help of people who understand it and help companies not to make the same mistake that others have made.
I hope you end up in an organization where they understand that Agile is based on trust, cooperation and passion. I hope this helps you to not blame mindsets, frameworks or even methodologies.
Good luck."

After all, project managers fulfill many roles and responsibilities as a part of the day-to-day functions of their jobs.
Project managers are responsible for creating an effective project plan, and all of the necessary ancillary plans, for the projects they oversee. They identify and manage risks associated with their projects. They must ensure that projects stay within their various constraints. The list goes on.
But before you can dive deeper into those details, you need to choose the right project management methodology to guide your efforts and usher your project through to completion.
There are many different methodologies to choose from, and each is best suited to different types of projects. Two of the most common (and often conflated) approaches to project management are Agile and Scrum. Given the similarities between the two, it’s easy to understand why they can sometimes be confused, but they are, in fact, two distinct concepts.
If an Agile approach is right for your project, you will then need to determine whether or not Scrum is the best Agile methodology for your specific needs and goals. Scrum is typically best suited to projects which do not have clear requirements, are likely to experience change, and/or require frequent testing."

I see no evidence that adopting “agile methodologies” will produce better outcomes than anything else. Every time I’m stuck in some boring meeting where everyone is droning on about scrum vs kanaban vs XP vs Pair programming I always ask the same three questions:
How doe we measure agility?
How agile are we now?
How much more agile will we become by adopting X?
In almost 9 years of putting up with all this agile crap I have never come across a single person or organization that has an actual, real, answer to the first question - forget about the other two.
This essentially means that virtually every discussion I’ve ever participated in wrt to Agile and improving Agile processes has consisted of nothing more than a bunch of people gazing at their navels and pulling stuff out of their asses.
There simply is no metric for agility and therefore no way to know if anything will improve it or not, and no way to know by how much. It is essentially a psuedoscience."
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-Scrum-Agile,Amitabh Saxena,Process Excellence and Data Science Evangelist at Anexas,2024-07,0,"My experience with Scrum and other Agile methodologies has been quite extensive and rewarding. Here are some key aspects of my experience:
Scrum Experience:
Role as a Scrum Master:Facilitated daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.Ensured the team followed Scrum practices and helped remove any impediments.Coordinated with product owners to prioritize the backlog and refine user stories.
Working as a Team Member:Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver increments of the product in sprints.Participated in estimation meetings using techniques like Planning Poker to evaluate user story points.Contributed to continuous improvement through sprint retrospectives.
Project Outcomes:Achieved improved project visibility and transparency through regular updates and feedback loops.Delivered high-quality software increments consistently within the sprint timelines.Fostered a culture of collaboration and accountability within the team.
Experience with Other Agile Methodologies:
Kanban:Implemented Kanban boards to visualize work in progress and limit work-in-progress (WIP) items.Used metrics like cycle time and lead time to identify bottlenecks and improve flow efficiency.Adapted to changing priorities quickly, allowing for continuous delivery and incremental improvements.
Lean:Applied Lean principles to eliminate waste and optimize processes.Focused on delivering value to the customer by streamlining workflows and reducing unnecessary steps.Encouraged a mindset of continuous improvement and respect for people within the team.
Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe):Participated in large-scale Agile transformations using the SAFe framework.Collaborated with multiple Agile teams in Program Increment (PI) planning sessions.Ensured alignment of team objectives with the overall business goals through regular synchronization and coordination.
Benefits Observed:
Increased Productivity: Agile methodologies foster a collaborative environment that enhances team productivity and efficiency.
Better Quality: Regular feedback and iterative development help in identifying and resolving issues early, leading to higher quality deliverables.
Enhanced Flexibility: Agile frameworks provide the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and market conditions quickly.
Improved Stakeholder Engagement: Regular communication and demonstration of progress keep stakeholders engaged and informed.
Challenges Faced:
Resistance to Change: Some team members initially resisted the shift to Agile practices, requiring additional training and support.
Coordination: Ensuring coordination among distributed teams posed challenges that were addressed through effective communication tools and practices.
Maintaining Discipline: Keeping the team disciplined in following Agile practices required constant attention and reinforcement."
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-Scrum-Agile,Robert Pieper,Professional Scrum Trainer at Scrum.org (2012–present),2017,144,"To be agile means to be nimble. If you can shed the weight of excessive bureaucracy, organize yourself and your teams in a way that collaboration is easy, you might just be agile.
Scrum is a framework to develop software using self organized's teams with clearly defined roles, artifacts, and events so that you might be agile. Done well I feel it's a great way to work and manage a project in a nimble way. The sad reality is that most don't do it well and think it's Scrum's fault. It's generally a misunderstanding of how to apply Scrum in the real world. Scrum doesn't tell you how to do your work. It just sets up some guide rails."
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-Scrum-Agile,Sam Granville,Project Manager,2021,1,"We cannot really compare them, the key difference between Agile and Scrum is that while Agile is a project management philosophy that utilizes a core set of values or principles, Scrum is a specific Agile methodology that is used to facilitate a project."
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-Scrum-Agile,Denise Canty,"President, Author, Agile Practitioner, Pgm Mgr at Cenden Company (1998–present)",2017,1,"I love the Agile methodology! I give agile a 9.5. Here are my reasons:
Agile is team focused. We win or fail as a team
Teams should be self directed and self organized
Value driven and there is no long wait to see value and results
Customer focused where the team works closely with the customer
Built in risk Mitigation
Very open to last minute changes
Adaptive
Very flexible
Light documentation"
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-Scrum-Agile,Chuck Cobb,Agile Project Mgt Author and Instructor (Over 100K Students),2016,1,"There are many stereotypes, myths, and misconceptions about Agile/Scrum. Many people see it as a ""silver bullet"" that will solve any problem you might have and many people also think it replaces all plan-driven methodologies (What people loosely refer to as ""Waterfall"").
A better way to look at it is that Agile/Scrum are good approaches for projects with high levels of uncertainty where adaptivity is more important than predictability. There is still a need for plan-driven approaches where the inverse is true - there is a lower level of uncertainty and predictability is more important than adaptivity. Those two approaches should be viewed as complementary to each other rather than competitive and it should not be viewed as a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between two extremes. There are plenty of ways to blend those two approaches together to fit a given situation.

agile is an umbrella term that relates to a mindset, scrum is a framework that may help you to achieve this mindset, but there are other ways"
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-Scrum-Agile,Chuck Cobb,Agile Project Mgt Author and Instructor (Over 100K Students),2019,1,"That’s a very broad question but here’s a simple answer. Agile and Scrum have a lot of benefits when applied correctly on the right kind of project. Agile/Scrum is not a “silver bullet” and not a solution to every problem you might have. It works best on projects that have a high level of uncertainty. Here are a few articles on that:

I like empirical process and like to review outcome as early as possible in order to aviod rework and waste.
Scrum guide is just 16 pages and don't need much time to understand until someone not ready to read even 16 pages."

However, I can provide information about scrum and agile methodology. Scrum is a widely used agile framework that focuses on iterative development, frequent communication, and collaboration within a cross-functional team. It helps streamline project management, improve productivity, and adapt to changing requirements.

https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-Scrum-Agile,The Big Flatino,GM (2013–present),2019,2,"About the same as unicorns. The Agile Methodology? What is that? No such thing. Agile is 4 values and 12 principles that can be applied in Scrum, Kanban, XP, Small Spiral, DSDM, RUP, SAFe, etc. My opinion of the values and principles are of the highest order."
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-Scrum-Agile,Riley Claire,Software Test Engineer | Technophile | Blogger,2022,0,"Agile is a mode of thinking, not a methodology; for example, how might value be given most suitably and effectively? Methods often consist of a systematic series of processes that are carried out inflexibly, i.e., each step must be carried out; this is not Agile (even if it is called an Agile Methodology).
The Agile methodology divides a project into many parts and uses these phases to manage the project. Continuous improvement at every level and ongoing cooperation with stakeholders are required. Teams cycle through a process of planning, carrying out, and assessing once the job starts."
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-Scrum-Agile,Naveen Kumar Singh,Confused agile coach but excellent software developer.,2017,2,"If you practice it properly then good else it will increase overhead. Industry is liking it so far and getting benefitted as well although not every company.
Agile not equals Scrum but Scrum is most popular way to achieve Agility. Some people hate Scrum and may be they failed in adopting it properly but Scrum is good way to start. You may drop it when you get maturity but need to have some processes and practices to start somewhere."
