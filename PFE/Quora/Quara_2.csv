Proper training and focus
With knowledge comes to vision and expertise. Lack of vision can be easily handled when one has an idea about the goals and how to achieve it.
Bringing teams together
With collaboration between teams comes productivity. Would it not be a constant process that had the role of building code by developers and checking code quality by testers become a single transparent job? It is only possible when both the teams work together in constant collaboration.
Flexible tool orchestration options
The best way to omit the problem of tool integration is to find the right options for tool orchestration.
Power of analytics
The integration of tools can help us gather relevant data and put them into one central repository.
