Although DevOps teams may face many challenges with the tools themselves (there are soo many and the learning curve is high), the hardest part is always the company culture and mindsets of people. Believe it or not, most people don’t like change. So adopting a new mindset, habits, rules and principles are the real challenges.
For example, how to make sure you align on technology/business decisions among teams? How to make sure everybody is multi-skilled? “I’m a Ops guy, I will not write code!” or “I’m a Java programmer, I’m not going to learn JavaScript!”. “What? I need to write tests myself, are you joking?” And do developers really want on pager-duty? Are we really deploying code to production without a DTAP process (read: manual verifications)?
Just some random quotes and questions that have nothing to do with technology, but need to be addressed if you want to build a true DevOps culture.
But like any other mindset/beliefs on the software development processes (Agile, Lean, DevOps) you want to implement for your company, technology is (almost) never the real challenge, its the company culture, habits and the mindset of people."
