Deleted Account,7,"Implementation of devops is essentially this:
1) Figure out the job you hate doing the most
2) automate it so no one ever has to do it again
3) rinse and repeat

Eventually you will start eliminating things other people hate then, before you know it you've implemented devops.",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
Deleted Account,1,"Well....you've implemented *automation*. Whether that automation feeds into a DevOps culture is a matter of how much buy-in, acceptance, and visibility those automation efforts garner.",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
inhumantsar,6,"Keep that ideal state in mind and practice the boy scout principle: Always leave a codebase better than you found out. 

Need to make a change to service x and it doesn't have automated deployments? Put one pr in for your change and another for the deploys.

I've been doing ""DevOps"" for over a decade at this point and can assure you that you'll throw out half of what you build early on. Don't stress about having a master plan or getting everything perfect the first time. Just focus on incremental improvements wherever you can achieve them.",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
scooby_pancakes,1,that would mean the dev env would stay in production for weeks until it's ready for testing?,2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
gdahlm,2,"FWIW, the Google SRE definition of 'toil' is a good model to explain the type of task you are looking to automate without it sounding like you are complaining about core job responsibilities.

Communication of value to the company and expressing both empathy for the toil of others and the value to the company are critical tasks when trying to implement DevOps

It is as much of a cultural change as a process change and people tend to resist change unless you acknowledge their concerns and demonstrate value.

Ask your boss what makes his job difficult and just listen, don't come back with products or process changes immediately.  Give it some time and come back with suggestions addressing his pain points directly.

Often these efforts can be perceived as adding risk of reduced velocity and most managers have been hit hard with these costly changes in the past.",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
Worth_Savings4337,1,"My situation is kinda similar to OP (as a junior Devops)

But i am more worried about my career progression. I don’t want to use this word “menial” but these task don’t really provide much impact compared to other roles in software development 

Right now, I am shifting myself towards cloud engineer, I think designing/building infrastructures will be more beneficial than just doing these menial Devops task",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
Deleted Account,1,"Cloud stuff is important but, as a manager of DevOps folks (and former DevOps guy) let me suggest you think less in terms of ""i want to work on technology x"" and more in terms of ""i want to solve problem y for people"" the menial crap is a good place to start. Dig in and figure out how to make it go away for everyone.",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
Worth_Savings4337,1,"Hi. Appreciate your input. May I ask, base on your experience, which do you think is a more valuable skillset? In terms of current market salary?

1) building CI/CD pipelines for developers
2) building AWS cloud infrastructures for users

Do you think CI/CD pipelines can be fully managed by cloud SaaS in future? A few years down the road",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
Deleted Account,1,In many cases CD/CD pipelines are fully managed now. I think both tasks are essential. What CI/CD tool are you using?,2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
Worth_Savings4337,1,"Jenkins. Selenium for test, Sonarqube for SAST

What? Most cases CI/CD pipelines are fully managed?

So which skillset is more valuable?",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
Deleted Account,1,"Ok there is absolutely no reason you can't build automation around creating Jenkins pipelines. Take a look at the documentation, work on writing a script to generate those pipelines automatically based on common patterns you see at your organization. Make it something you can run first then set up a website you can hook it into.",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
Worth_Savings4337,1,"No what I am worried about is, is CI/CD a dead end job compared to cloud which is user-centric (same like software engineers building apps for users) so we won’t be treated as a cost center

I guess cloud is a higher paying skill than CI/CD",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
Deleted Account,1,"Thats's hard to say. I've worked at a lot of companies some you've heard of and some you haven't. Most of them have Developer Experience people who spend their days asking ""How can we make better CI/CD pipelines?"" They also have cloud infrastructure people asking ""How do we get application services stood up quickly and robustly?"" Both have people who have progressed through the career paths of their companies to the highest paid bands.   For the most part the people who have progressed answer both of those questions the same way. That answer is ""automate all the things."" 

You need to see the grunt work as an opportunity for automation. Thats how you build value.",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
devopswithbrian,1,"For me a lot of it is leading by example and showing devs and others why “this is the way”.  In my most recent role I’ve setup example pipelines, built jobs as code, redid a lot of our stuff as code and documented how it all worked and how to contribute back.

Now I have devs writing their own pipelines and jobs via code using my cookicutter templates and we have all our new aws accounts as code.

Sometimes it helps to just show people and not cram it down their face.",2022,How to properly implement DevOps to a company?
