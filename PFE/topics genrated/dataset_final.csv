Taxes is just one aspect, it also matters what you need to cover out of pocket based on personal situations and prices for services and commutes plus more. 

Sure, if one is young and healthy, no kids, don't want to settle with a house etc. it can be beneficial to be in a HCoL city in the US making 250-300k+ USD. Spending a bit on a fun life, but still saving quite a bit for a future life.

On the other hand, someone who wants to settle, have kids or has kids, needs medical services (basically at one point, everyone needs something, even if just a sprain or a twisted ankle), buy property, who needs WLB and stability with their work, I'm in no doubt that EU is the better option. This doesn't even consider the gun violence and homeless/drug situation raging the US currently...

Now also consider, that 1k USD in disposable income (money left after all regular bills paid) is likely to get far more value in EU than US for local services. Sure, globalization and major brands consumer goods will be a different matter, but this accounts for maybe 5-10% of total usage of disposable income, tops 20%. The rest will be restaurants, leisure/enjoyment, cinema, spa/body treatments and more that will mainly consist of local services provided by local labor and conditions.

With a high quality of life and eating out healthy (not fast food with few exceptions, but actual restaurant cooked food with healthy ingredients and salad) at least 5-6 meals a week (yes, about 1 meal a day on average), going to saunas/spas, having 2 cars, owning 2 flats with mortgage, yearly unlimited transit pass, drinking great original pilsner beers at pubs multiple times per week, affording travel by plane and hotel once every 2 months on planned budgets and more.

Total monthly budget to cover all this for two people? 2,500 EUR. Then I add in 1,500 to savings/investments, and it is covered by my 4k net salary. Taxes are around 22% after deductions, and my gross is 5k.

My wife pays her part according to her proportional income compared to mine, so that's 500 of the budget. I have 500 ""fuck it whatever"" money each month outside of savings, generally my beer and ""fun times with buddies"" money...

And when we get kids, the discretionary budget for food and clothing, utilities and maybe some babysitting/ services, it will maybe increase by 500 EUR a month. Then I'll be a dad, so no need for ""fuck it whatever"" money anymore. Child birth and medical expenses will be fully covered...

How much would I need to make in the US to match this lifestyle 🙂? Sorry for the long text, but to provide context. I really don't see how the US could make my situation any better, and neither does my wife",4,1.0

We initially started the project with Bitbucket because the evaluation of Gitlab and Github left a bad taste behind, this was pre GHA. After a few years and constantly running into the slowness and limitations of Bitbucket we re-evaluated those three and slowly moved everything to GitLab over a year. The features were vastly superior, the bits we lacked in Bitbucket were available by default (and had been for years, i saw an update on the Bitbucket feature ticket recently, someone started work on it 9 years after it was reported) and the team had up-skilled and gotten more used to the terminology and understanding of the CI features.

Going from SaaS to a similar SaaS was fairly trivial since most of the scripting stayed the same, images used. etc. Mainly just the formatting and structure of the YAML varied.

The only issue remaining is the slowness of the pipelines using the default runners when we're doing outside our own business hours pipeline runs, since that puts us in the primetime EU and US business day hours.",-1,0.0

DevOps is like agile - it's a methodology. I've never understood why companies hire DevOps engineers when they wouldnt ever hire an agile engineer. It's assumed that you understand the methodology and should be able to work using it effectively. 

DevOps roles often times are just another way of saying platform engineer. But some companies use it for SREs. Others use it for actual software Devs as well. When you've got such a varying range, it's inevitable you'll get people who'll have done DevOps engineering roles at one company and completely bomb the interview at another since they might be looking for a completely different skillset. 

I have now started to ask more about what exactly the company is wanting out of a DevOps engineer and often times they are looking for either an SRE or a pure platforms engineer. I've had some instances where the company is actually looking for a software engineer with infra experience. 

This, I feel, is the crux of the issue. There's no set definition of a DevOps engineer. So you get people who might be great in one role but not for another. For a software engineer, the definitions are clear. You need to know data structures, algos, and designing large and distributed software. DevOps tho. You need CICD, cloud, containers, scripting, Unix, python/Go, kubernetes, and some other stuff. People will have experience but one job may require an expert in UNIX and not have much python but another will be the opposite. So it's not really the candidate pool is bad but the way to industry has decided to approach this specific role is resulting in the current issues.",0,0.9726521203856106

I read the site.

>Most CICD tools available today use a push-based model. A push-based pipeline means that code starts with the CI system and then continues its path through a series of encoded scripts to push changes to the Kubernetes cluster. The reason you don’t want to use your CI system as the basis for your deployments is because of the potential to expose credentials outside of your cluster. While it is possible to secure your CI scripts, you are still working outside the trust domain of your cluster which is not recommended.

so yeah they think it's better to have an agent on the system pull from git, rather than having automation triggered by git, but that is only for security reasons (as i said earlier, because it means you need to log in to systems). it has nothing to do with whether or not you manage your state with git as a single source of truth.

They don't seem to say it now, but it was this just guy doing consulting, who starting selling licenses to his clients that he personally knew, so he called his company ""Big Faceless Organization"" as a joke. 

So, I had an idea: **markdown templates**. Most uses of BFO's library will have boilerplate and data filled it. Probably, people would start doing it with explicit java code, but then will introduce templates (so they can be updated/fixed/experimented with easily, quickly, without programming skill - by anyone in the corp, perhaps a domain expert...) that the java just fills in.

But while HTML templates are common (and ****), a markdown template would be far easier and clearer to work with. [ easier still would be wysiwyg, massive overkill for this type of job). Though I'm not sure if markdown has the capabilities that would be needed for such tasks... that's something to look in to. You can do tables, but I find them pretty tricky and confusing in practice. Anyway, it would look something like:

Let me explain:
1. Cultural Resistance
One of the toughest hurdles is shifting the organizational mindset. DevOps is about collaboration between development and operations teams, but many companies still operate in silos. Resistance to change, whether from leadership or team members, can slow adoption. Overcoming this requires strong leadership support and continuous education on the benefits of DevOps.
2. Legacy Systems and Processes
Organizations often have outdated systems or processes that aren't compatible with modern DevOps practices. Migrating to a new infrastructure or automating legacy workflows is complex and time-consuming. Additionally, there's always a risk of downtime, which makes teams hesitant to make significant changes.
3. Tool Overload and Integration
The DevOps ecosystem is vast, with countless tools for CI/CD, monitoring, version control, and more. While options are great, choosing the right tools and ensuring seamless integration is a significant challenge. Overloading teams with too many tools can lead to inefficiencies rather than solving problems.
4. Skill Gaps
DevOps requires a mix of skills in development, operations, automation, and sometimes even security. Finding professionals who have expertise across these areas can be difficult, leading to slower implementation or overburdened teams.
5. Security in DevOps (DevSecOps)
Security sometimes takes a back seat as DevOps accelerates the software delivery pipeline. Integrating security practices without disrupting the speed of deployment is a balancing act many organizations struggle with.
6. Measuring Success
Defining and measuring meaningful metrics for DevOps success is tricky. Metrics like deployment frequency, mean time to recovery (MTTR), or lead time for changes help, but aligning them with business goals and demonstrating ROI is another challenge.
Conclusion
DevOps is transformative, but it's not without its challenges. Addressing these requires strong leadership, the right tools, skilled professionals, and a willingness to embrace continuous improvement. By tackling this head-on, organizations can unlock the full potential of DevOps.

This applies to every CICD that accepts pipeline files. They have their own DSL language to write the pipelines. Even more most people actually write wrappers to write in their favorite language if they have something advanced.

> I can't hand a bunch of Jenkins DSL over to an Dev team

If anything, a Dev team should be the best one that learn Jenkins DSL, because you know... They are programmers, not Jira Power Users...

> Whereas, with most modern CI/CDs, they use an common and widely accepted file format

So you are going to refuse to use Chef or Terraform or Vagrant because they don't use YAMLs? It's Groovy Syntax which is basically a Java Scripting Language.

> you have to basically be an expert at Jenkins and their Jenkinsfile/DSL to be even remotely effective

This is universally true for every language and CICD. Whatever you do in Jenkins that it requires expert levels will be the same in Gitlab or Github actions. 

I can agree that YAMLs are human readable at a different level than any other config language, but this does not mean you require a different skill level to achieve the same thing you would do in Gitlab or GitHub.

Sure, Github actions actually has some built in managed features that work quite well with their platform, one that comes into my mind is the deployer feature where you can generate nice changelogs and patchnotes for users.

> using any technology which ""gates"" people (intentionally or unintentionally) from being able to understand, support, maintain, and use it.

This is equally valid for every pipeline language out there. You have specific syntax to the pipelines and you have to learn the building block. 

Developers that never seen Gitlab CI syntax will be equally gated by it as you would have developers that never seen Jenkins DSL language...

This analogy is similar to actually putting a Java Developer handle a python project and expect the same results and agility in fixing issues because we are talking about Developers.

> Jenkins does something which I as an DevOps consultant firmly stand against

Jenkins literally has Shared Libraries, Template Jobs, Pipeline Jobs, Configuration as a Code, Dynamic and Static Agents, capability of a full blown scripting language, easy extensive plugins and is open source.

Jenkins literally has everything that a software actually needs to be everlasting and supported for at least 10years. 

I don't see how you are augmenting this as Jenkins literally has the same things that Gitlab has and it is decoupled from your repository system.

>  Jenkins is one of those insanely over-complicated technologies

This is slander. There is nothing complicated about Jenkins right now. Anyone can easily spin it over docker, learn how to use the pipelines, connect an agent and it will work out for everyone...

You have to equally do the things to Gitlab but even bother of the repository, gitlab becomes even more critical with a lot of moving components that can fail independent. Inside Gitlab you have everything, you have issue tracking, wiki, cicd and the main feature which is Git Code Repositories...

You are literally running a monolith application in a world where everyone wants to decouple things and ensure everything is not critically dependent of each other component.",3,0.8158932683395953

One of the big problems being security. Automating server provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, software lifecycle, are all great things but not much thought went into how to secure these new systems. 

I can’t tell you how many times I have seen clear text  creds in repos, api keys not being rotated, and two factor not being implemented.

Yes things are more efficient and teams can go faster but at what cost??

The way to secure these issues often is more approval, silos, and bureaucracy. Teams are forced to slow down because there whole company is in risk of a cyber attack that can be reputation damaging. Companies need to go fast to be competitive. Look at the game Palworld with a budget of 10,000 that did not follow any industry best practices and are eating nintendos lunch right now. 

No one organization has the one tool that can achieve centralization to full automate the stack. Often it a barrage of tools that do similar things that “devops” team argue about religiously and change to different tool set or develop their own tools. You cannot centralize your team if there are all these different tools and no standardization. I think this is the biggest problem. Now instead of one Brent there are several.

>There are also audits and other things you need to do to qualify for standards and insurances. Software that comes from random sources is not trusted. Each and every line must have a guarantor to back it up. This is why MS shared its source code with govt and other valuable customers.

You're an idiot if you somehow think that *nix software isn't audited as well. And as far as ""sharing source with government"", it's far, far easier for them to get Linux source than it is MS source. ",-1,0.0

Devops, to me, is a role that focuses on automation in operations and creating tools to help in the maintenance of a service.

While there's still a place for the hardcore ops guys in optimization and fire fighting, a lot of that responsibility can be automated away, and exposed to the developer in a way that's straightforward and makes sense to a software engineer.

In addition, ""devops"" has the role of building out the platform in a way that, again, makes sense to a software engineer.

Take setting up a monitoring system:
An ops guy will install nagios, setup checks on the core server stats (cpu, du, network, etc) and add something to make sure an application is running, and setup something to page him when things are bad.  Every few mornings he'll go in and yell at the dev who made him wake up in the middle of the night to restart an app.

A DevOps guy will setup a system such that when someone creates or adds to a service, they can configure checks that alert off of the business metrics and core performance metrics of that service.  He'll then setup a system by which they can convert those checks into a configurable form of alert that gets back to the owner of that system.  The original developer can now consume metrics and manage alerts in a way they are familiar with.  They have more ownership of alerts and really fix problems instead of just rebooting.

Yes, this does change the Developer's responsibilities slightly.. they now care about the systems they are creating instead of the algorithms they are pumping out.   That, IMO, is a good thing.

As far as full stack engineers, I think that role has always existed.  Maybe the OP is just more in tune with the job market now?   A specialist (ops or dev) still have their place in companies that really need specialization.    Someone who wants to play with multiple levels of technology, which I think would be a large % of techie devs, will be happy to fill the full stack roles.",0,0.9047418296586458

- getting a good handle on everything that k8s can do takes months, not weeks. 
- Zooming out, working with k8s has an implicit assumption: you have some understanding of how applications get made and deployed.

You have to understand those problems to understand how k8s solves them. 
- These questions are totally normal, but they are also answered in numerous different ways in the docs and in videos. You’re gonna have to put in the time learning/watching/reading.

Here are a few common scenarios that cause/effect an organization in to different levels of disfunction:

Any decision made regarding tech will nearly always be a compromise, there are so many choices that any choice will have a pretty significant change management issue JUST by picking one choice over another.

Adoption and change management is forever underrated, stakeholders are not properly identified and some will feel like they should have a loud voice even though it doesn't matter making them feel bad.

The day you pick any technology/platform: that's the day you got an outdated piece of technology/platform. There is always something newer/better/more fantastical and engineers/business users will forever think the wrong choice was made due to something else being either newer or potentially more mature or just more better in solving the problem that they think is the most important.

Overall there is an idea of ""I made the choice and told people what the choice was"" being the way to implement anything. It isn't once you adopt any process/application/platform it is a constant cycle of adoption improvement communication etc. If you stop with any of these at any time your program will fail to some degree.

Honestly thinking that the field is greener anywhere else if the above things bother you: good luck, it isn't greener. This is a fact of life and it's really no one's fault even if we like to blame the users (be they devs or business users) it really isn't all on them. I am not saying ignore the problem or stop caring, but it's important to realize what scope of change you can affect AND that this is the same across the board everywhere. There are simply other things that soften the blow like orgs that do take adoption seriously, allow for transparency and openness, get the right people involved and attempt to tear down the silos. Even there people will grump about poor choices/architectures whatever either now, tomorrow or a year from now.

It will help you to increase your organizational capacity to deliver software and services effectively. But, working with a DevOps team is challenging.
Here’ I’m sharing some of my thoughts.
Costly: DevOps is costly. The salary range of DevOps is the highest in the software industry. If you want to work with a DevOps team, you must be ready to bear the cost.
Hard to find: DevOps is hard to find. If you want to hire a developer for your business, you must find an experienced developer. Because a fresher does not have the capacity like a pro developer. But finding a pro is not an easy task.
There are some challenges of DevOps from my list like hard to retain, focused on tools, moving from legacy infrastructure to microservices, overcoming the Dev versus Ops mentality, toolset clashes, etc. You may face more challenges.",-1,0.0

He hated that we developers were deploying complete Oracle systems. Basically he saw that we weren't billing him out on our projects. The reasons were quite simple. Our projects were small. Oracle was dead easy to install. And basically he brought nothing to the table but confusion. We had one client who was getting their data from another source. They would get a weekly update in the form of a SQL file. The incoming schema wasn't that great but it was a big file but with indexes it was well fast enough. So he spends a weekend redoing the entire schema of the imported data and then sends a report to the client documenting the million ways his schema was better. 

Our solution was the epitome of elegance. We would run the new data into the server in one huge transaction and if there were no errors commit the transaction. We even checked to make sure the import was safe to import. With his system we would have had to build an import tool that would somehow convert the incoming data into his zillion table schema. 

We told the client that they didn't have to pay for his time as it was not authorized by me (the project manager) and that in order to implement his solution the project would be late and we would be charging for at least a week's time to implement a new complicated import tool. 

This was a DBA desperate to protect his job.

Now if we were running a bank's central database, then by all means they should have a team of specialist DBAs. 

But the simple reality is that at this point in time end to end development is pretty **** easy. I would be reluctant to hire a developer who didn't know how to implement every aspect of a system in at least a crude way. 

Ideally all your developers are end to end with various strengths in the different areas and thus take on problems in those areas. But if one of those super specialists is not available for whatever reason then I would fully expect other developers to step right in. 

I would say that as the company becomes larger that the spread of skills within any developer can become narrower.

But there is one area that developers often are 100% lacking and that is design. Also great designers are often lacking in development. So I would generally not expect much overlap between these two areas. 

But even business needs to be a common overlap. I have seen way too many programmers and IT people completely not understand the needs of the business. A great example is how many IT departments will stand fully in the way of the salesmen being able to sell. One company that I worked for limited the sales people to 10mb per email attachment, when most of the sales PDF were in the 10-20mb range. Needless to say the Head of IT had no limit to his attachment size. Keep in mind that this was a sales driven company. So I don't care if that guy had the most secure and reliable system in the world; he was actively damaging the company.

So I would say that anyone who doesn't have a broad range of skills should go back to academia and pretend like it is reality; because to the real world a single skilled developer is worse than useless regardless of how high a guru status they have achieved.

While DevOps has many benefits, such as faster time-to-market and improved software quality, there are several challenges that companies may face when implementing DevOps. Some of the main challenges include:
Cultural Resistance: Implementing DevOps requires significant changes in organizational culture, including breaking down silos between teams, promoting collaboration, and emphasizing continuous improvement. This can be difficult in organizations with entrenched processes and hierarchies, where there may be resistance to change.
Lack of skills and expertise: DevOps requires a range of technical skills, such as automation, testing, and deployment, as well as soft skills, such as communication and collaboration. Finding employees with the necessary skills and expertise can be a challenge, and companies may need to invest in training and development to build their DevOps capabilities.
Tooling and Technology Integration: DevOps relies heavily on automation and the integration of different tools and technologies. Ensuring that these tools work together seamlessly can be challenging, particularly when integrating with legacy systems.
Managing Complexity: DevOps often involves managing complex and distributed systems, which can make it difficult to identify and resolve issues. This can lead to downtime and other performance issues, which can be costly for the organization.
Security and Compliance: With DevOps, there is a risk of introducing security vulnerabilities and compliance issues if security and compliance considerations are not integrated into the development and delivery process. Companies need to ensure that their DevOps processes meet security and compliance requirements.
In summary, implementing DevOps requires significant changes in organizational culture, technical and soft skills, tooling and technology integration, and addressing security and compliance. Companies need to plan and execute carefully to address these challenges and ensure a successful DevOps implementation.",0,1.0

(I didn't get the job).   One of the directors interviewing me asked how I planned on motivating ""ops"" guys who were accumstomed to instant gratification, so they would transition into more proactive developer roles.

That question really stuck with me.  Not because of the management aspect, but the personality differences between your typical developer and your typical operations/sysAdmin.

Often times a developer does what he feels is best because that's what he believes - sometimes to a fault.

A systems admin is used to fighting fires, answering phone calls and emails from important people, and generally living in the moment, often seeking the approval of others.

For whatever reason I always presumed ""DevOps"" meant sys admins acting as devs, not the opposite direction.",-1,0.0

'DevOps engineers play a crucial role: They bridge the gap between development and operations, automating processes, breaking down silos, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
 * Key responsibilities of a DevOps engineer might include:
   * Automating infrastructure provisioning and management
   * Implementing CI/CD pipelines
   * Monitoring and troubleshooting production systems
   * Collaborating with development teams to improve software delivery processes'

This is precisely why it's such a difficult hire. Not many people are cloud engineer, platform engineer AND sre, and on top of that have a deep understanding of how software development works.

And even AI, when asked to look at cncf, literally says 'collaborating with development teams'.

Stop trying to hire a 'devops engineer', instead, look at what your company/client needs. A dev with a deep understanding of how to improve and automate the build process? A platform engineer? An sre? An architect? A traditional ops who knows how to improve and automate the delivery process?

And here, gemini didn't even mention security. Perhaps you need a security expert.

The thing we realized is that those sort of interviews optimize to hire a specific type of very Jr Engineers who have recently graduated or are graduating from CS. That is because those are the people that have the time to churn these types of ""puzzle"" problems. Particularly, there are 3 types of recent graduates from CS or related fields:  The ones that don't know ****, the ones that focus on these sort of problems, and the ones that are ""generalists"" because they dove into all sort of subjects during their degree. 

I found out that the Jr people that excel at those sort of problems have a huge learning curve to climb to be productive in ""production, real life environment.   On the contrary, the ""generalists"" work better.

We stopped doing those sort of algorithm puzzles interviews after that realization, and we started getting really good Engineers with great real-life experience.",9,0.5442768702058491

So we set up a pilot project where we started hosting, maintaining and upkeeping a set of tools consisting roughly of Jira+Confluence, Jenkins as the CI/CD server, Artifactory for binary hosting and  Bitbucket/Gitlab for source code.It has worked **** well for the first pilot company (signed on 5+ years ago), the second one, and by the third the platform started selling itself (getting a public reference from the first couple companies helped a lot). The second reason for the easy buy-in is to use known software that our customers could host themselves if they had to. This practically means that we aren’t vendor-locking them with our own proprietary tools. We just take care of off-the-shelf tools.If there is a competent tooling team that takes care of the intricacies of the tools and maintains their uptimes, the dream of ""you build it you run it"" can still live. There is a giant gap between ""you build it you run it"" and reality -- much how there is a gap between a pilot being able to fly a plane and a pilot knowing how to maintain an Airbus, the airport and the runways.It says something about the job market that losing a customer pretty much never happens.

I've outlined two of my biggest concerns below below, and have also addressed the topic over at IT Business Edge: Top Five DevOps and Ops Team Challenges for 2015.
Ownership Wars Might Be Stifling Culture
While culture is a fundamental part of DevOps, it goes well beyond Ninjas, Rockstars, and hoodies. At its core, DevOps culture is about fostering collaboration and results-driven effort. However, until operations can figure out how to better foster culture within its daily activities, this aspect of DevOps will not flourish. Infrastructure is still in operations' full control, but the culture needs to span across development silos and embrace shared data, shared tools and shared approaches. Without a sound DevOps culture, getting the proper processes in place and tools implemented will be much more challenging.
The ""Tool/App for That"" Generation
The pressure from business users who believe everything can be solved with ""a simple app"" has become downright destructive. Business users are adamant in their knowledge about great tools, and thanks to the emergence of open source or SaaS-based offerings, users can often start using a free trial of the tool instantly – cutting out operational oversight. Even better, most users assume every tool should/does have an app. But even if there is an app, it must be properly tied to everything else to be useful.
Operations must support the tool/app evolution to maintain awareness, governance and control. Managing the adoption, integration and quantification of an endless supply of tools and apps is no small task so leveraging the shared services concept to balance tool delegation and management must be done early on.",0,1.0

It was more cumbersome, less easy to test and as a result when a reliable pattern was completed and created most things were jammed into it. It's a big reason why something like Java was so popular. Create your jar file and its now pretty portable and self-contained.   


With the rise of cloud computing DevOps has transformed the way we work with servers, and containers have pushed this even further to the point where we want the hardware to be ""dumb"" and the containers/code to be smarter. Optimizations and abstractions have helped to further this simplification of the ops process and historical operations work has shifted from people in a data center running hardware to a more hybrid role of managing permissions,  creation of strong flexible patterns and an increase in testing. Programming languages have become easier to work with as tools have gotten significantly better, but also so has the tooling to deploy and host websites with ease.   


At a certain point the traditional sysadmin work has become less and less necessary outside of data centers and general knowledge about these lower level systems has become less and less of a necessity for engineers to have. Issues occasionally crop up but for the most part the need to tinker and hyper optimize at the server layer is going away except for companies running their own data centers like old Fortune 500's or Amazon.   


DevOps roles now align more with the principles of Site Reliability and have even shifted towards platform engineering concepts that rely on developers to gain a bit more knowledge of infrastructure and the simplification of already abstracted deployment processes in order to help them code quickly and push changes rapidly while catching errors in the process. These patterns have resulted in massive increases in productivity in engineers and are also why we're paid so well.",-1,0.0

I'd be impressed with a candidate who walked me through how s/he'd set up a lightweight module with the VPC itself, subnets, route tables, gateways and any custom stuff like DHCP options / transit gateway attachments / etc. In so doing, they'd display underlying knowledge, enthusiasm and a fondness for clean code.

I can believe that. At least for me, it's because I know jack squat about devops and I want to try put in an honest effort before bothering the devops gods.  
  
Since data scientists don't typically go down the comp sci path in uni, or maybe only take a class or two, they're often lacking some of the fundamentals when it comes to software development and I think it can trick normal devs and engineers into thinking we should know about X because we do Y, whereas for a dev if they do Y they know X.  
  
So it kind of creates this awkward situation where you can't play dumb and inexperienced and have the devops hold your hand unashamedly because from the devops perspective, we should know what they're talking about and what it is they do. In some sense, it's like how a data scientist might expect a dev/engineer to know more about analytics pipelines and SQL than most do, because from the DS perspective we think ""well they do database and SQL stuff in the backend"" but the application is quite a bit different.",17,0.502171465617197

Its okay for teams to do some things their own way but some basic sort of standardization is needed. An embedded engineer does not have the time to figure out the underlying lets say TF or K8s pipelines that should be used across the org. 

I personally prefer working on a central DevOps team and having more input on the foundations of infra as well as getting to work with various dev teams on projects and learning about how they do things (rather than within a single team).

My recent experiences have been exactly like you describe, they just say ""get it done"" and they explicitly say that as devops I have essentially no say in what or how or when. The whole idea of ""devops is a mindset, not a role"" is completely dead in the water.

Most recently, I had some really wild managers (non technical obviously) who decided that we should move all the isolated customer instances onto a single VM to save money. And this had to be done immediately, like in 2 weeks otherwise the whole business will go under.

Tried to explain to them that we are already on cloud, we can just buy smaller VMs if we need less resources, that we still need to be able to guarantee a certain amount of resources to every instance, that the VM isolation level is really important for compliance, and that what they are suggesting is only going to cost more money.

They just hated my **** techno babble, and ignored it. And this was not some backyard chop shop, this was a big consulting firm.

https://puppet.com/resources/report/2021-state-of-devops-report/

(no; I actually hate their product and think it's **** and useless, but this report is absolutely what you're looking for if you want the answers to the questions you've asked).


As for me:
Current-job - it's a young startup (who ships their product as containers, is not even a web-service), and the developers don't understand any of this devops stuff.  I have my work cut out for me. :)  I'm hoping that with NONE of the 'legacy stack' problems of my previous jobs, that I'll be able to succeed here.  Though I'm hired more specifically for my security experience, and the Devops lead is actually pretty green.

Previous job - 15 year-old startup SaaS; over the last 2 years, we migrated to AWS, but a lot of it was really lift-and-shift because the legacy platform was ridiculously poorly architected, (we're talking Rube-Goldberg level) and most of the staff who had any understanding of how it worked, has left or forgotten. They're engaged in what's probably their 4th attempt (doomed to failure IMO) at re-writing the whole stack. Their problem is their FOUNDING team of about 5 developers who are just too set in their ways, and who are politically untouchable due to their tenure at the company. They SAY they want to modernize, but they don't actually want to do it, and they don't want to help new staff come up to speed. It's like they hate that they had to grow past the original team of 5.  They were purchased just before I left, so I assume the new owners are going to try to make changes. Maybe another re-write attempt? 

Previous job: a lot of the same problems. Legacy stack, no developer expertise in-house. Multiple aborted stacked re-write attempts accumulated over about 15 years. Also huge staff turnover, I started as a junior devops (that was all I could get as a 20-year veteran systems engineer, without all the ""buzzword compliant"" stuff on my resume - my core skills are really more security oriented), then the two levels of management above me got frustrated working with the upper-management team and quit, leaving me ""in charge of devops"" but basically a junior (in terms of pay, and authority), so I also noped-out. Not before I completely built a set of devops tooling, and evangelized it to the dev team. I hope they did something with it, but I seriously doubt it.

Job before that: Company is 70 years old; and an old-school silicon valley technology company, but in a very diverse market of specialized disciplines. This company actually did a GREAT job at rewriting one of their products, (though it was a 100% on-prem - short-term, very high security requirements). I automated that whole thing end-to-end, (and that was before there was most of the current devops tooling even existed) - and it was so successful (in terms of cost-savings for re-deployments) that they were able to spin it off to a subsidiary.  As for the rest of the company, there was another outfit; part of the IT group; which was really trying to become a ""Platform Team"" but I think they didn't succeed either, because of the very diverse offerings and needs of different dev teams, and it was really impossible to build a ""one-size-fits-all"" devops solution at that company: and probably always will be.   I know they spent 2 years farting around trying to succeed with an on-prem kubernetes cluster, built on a warehouse of old, repurposed desktop machines. They suffered from a lot of hardware setbacks, which put them in perpetual stagnation.",-1,0.0

The goal is to limit work in progress, have the team swarm together on one thing at a time, *get it shipped,* and then get stakeholder feedback as quickly as possible.  But this requires teams to have the right skillsets to do this and applications which are loosely coupled enough to reduce dependencies outside the team.

You shouldn't be ""pushing"" anyone to ""get over to Kanban.""  If that works for them, great.  If not, OK, try something else.  But it does make me wonder what ""Kanban"" is in your mind if you somehow think it's to be contrasted against ""Agile.""",13,1.0

Oh, you mean like every sysadmin on the planet worth their salt has already been doing with their scripts for decades? What a novel concept.

Script automation is not the same as stateful enforcement, like you see in docker containers/equivalent.

> And a lot of the training I took actually recommends the use of specific, brand-named tools. Gee, no way kick-backs were involved there.

Plenty of that going on, but it's not exclusively that. There's plenty of open source options such as rancher, argo-cd, codium, etc. The existence of ""premium"" closed source options does not mean they are the only option.

> A lot of companies just use it as an excuse to put Sysadmin responsibilities on the Developers

And this is where it is an improper implementation. DevOps staff and SREs are the dedicated resources that should be taking that role on, not Developers directly.

It sounds like you're working at a place that is not really properly implementing it. This is not an accurate representation of what it can be like.

> DevOps itself is literally nothing more than a way for corporate consultants to swoop in, change a few processes, stick ""Implemented DevOps Strategies"" on their resume

While that does happen, your representation here is a far cry from when it is correctly implemented.

I can empathise with your jaded position, but do not allow yourself to believe that this is the reality everywhere.

You can make great automation with every decent took IF you give DevOps engineers time to automate automation tool configuration itself.
I'm in a lucky positions where my boss doesn't complain about time because he trust me. 

Results: we begun to move to Gitlab from another CICD...
First pipeline (only build) -> time 1 month. Second pipeline -> still 1 month (but using templates) -- in the meantime gitlab components came out - third pipeline -> 1,5 month build + unit test (but using components),  fourth pipeline 3 weeks  build + unit test + integration test + deployment , fifth pipeline.. 2h , with all as the previous one.

10 years ago i would happily pull apart a sun u2 and replace the eeprom when it shat itself. now? not my thing. i spend my days elbow deep in chef, cobbler, cloud APIs, monitoring APIs, jenkins, JIRA, bash, ruby, and python.

i've had to back off the actual typing a little so that i can spend time with our devs to learn how their optimal workflows should look and help design our systems to make their lives easier (ie. give them more time to code). we talk with QA, product, sales, and management to architect an environment where everyone's job is their main focus, not everyone else's job. we make deployments safe, sane, and most of all...hands-off. there are few things as wasteful as forcing your developers to take time off from coding to run some hare-brained capistrano script and deploy code. we design systems and workflows to link issue tracking, version control, build, QA, and deploy so that when the SoX/PCI/HIPAA/whatever auditor shows up, the CFO doesn't end up in jail or when some godawful bug like heartbleed shows up and all our customers are **** their collective pants, we can prove that remediation was swift and comprehensive.

You might have a specialised platform team that provides a platform as a service to the Dev teams but only to remove blockers, not create them. That team should not be called a DevOps team because there is no DevOps team in DevOps.

However, like everything else, corporate IT management takes something good and twists it around until it means the same as they were doing before with some new tools and names. That destroys the value of the whole thing.

I suggest you read the Phoenix Project and the Unicorn Project by Gene Kim and [https://minimumcd.org/minimumcd/](https://minimumcd.org/minimumcd/)

They key thing is this. If you are blocking the application development and support teams then they are going to find ways around you and that will make you  irrelevant.

I don't disagree with this over the long term! But again, I fear that I would have to take a pay cut to get started. I have 7 years of experience (almost entirely sysadmin with a focus on Microsoft tech), many IT certs, and am at the point where I'm looking for senior sysadmin/team lead roles. When it comes to DevOps job postings, anything that pays similar to what I'm making now seems to insist on 2 - 3 years or experience with Docker, K8s, etc. I worry they wouldn't be interested if I am a good sysadmin but only have home lab experience with these DevOps tools. And again, then I could get into a *junior* DevOps position, but make around 30% less than I do now. This wouldn't work for my family, unfortunately. 

I think I would need to get lucky and find the right job at the right time - similar to how you mentioned in a comment finding a Linux admin/automation job, and not a formal ""DevOps Engineer"" posting (or whatever title they chose). I think something like ""Automation engineer"" would be a great entry point for me. But those seem harder to find than ""DevOps Engineer"" etc. postings that are calling for several years of DevOps experience. 

&#x200B;

>What is your concern about remote work? 

Sorry, I wasn't clear - I love and am all for remote work, and do almost 100% WFH right now, and want to keep it that way! I guess it doesn't matter if there aren't any *local* DevOps jobs, but it still feels scary to switch to a field without anything local. I guess remote jobs aren't about to go away and I should get this fear out of my head.

Overall, I think I would love to work for an org practicing DevOps, but am still just not convinced the amount of training required would have an immediate payoff. And if that's the case, I can continue pursuing more knowledge of Microsoft cloud tech and continue to advance on that side.

Maybe long term I could pursue the ""Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert"" cert, and keep an eye out for remote DevOps postings that would give a seasoned (but not crusty) sysadmin a shot. Would just have to pray that home lab experience would be enough, since any enterprise I've worked at doesn't even seem to know what DevOps is yet 😂",-1,0.0

System administrator is the role - the goal of the job is still the same, the way it's done has changed.

I was a developer who has been gradually pushed into a sysadmin role at a small development company - mainly because of my extensive experience with Linux (using it since 1996) - and since I do have some sense of infrastructure and how should be managed.

Most of my colleague-developers however - who are very good at their job - don't have a clue about system administration or infrastructure. I always got questions about infrastructure related things that would make me wonder on which planet they live, most developers really don't have a clue about 'operations' - and certainly about 'good practices'. Some for example question the usefulness of ssh keys, not even mentioning key-only ssh access on servers, others would create multiple Debian packages of the same software, pre-configured to be able to be installed and run on one system for one specific client. Luckily, I'm calling the shots about stuff like that now.

So what the author of the article says about a developer being able to do a decent sysadmin job? Forget it. 90% of the developers will manage to keep things running, but don't expect anything else from them. Manageability will be below zero, I know from experience. I inherited an infrastructure mess of a few hundred VM's in a 20-ppl company, all with the same passwords, multiple distributions, including ancient slackware 8 machines, that were all managed by 'developers'.

Today, most of them barring Ansible are irrelevant for the time as Containers have made them largely unnecessarily. The only tool you need to bother about in Iac is Terraform.  

As for CI, it can not be standardised basis of tool as every org has  their own suit (Atlassian, vs GitHub vs GitLab vs Azure Devops) and will continue ot use them.

The DOE should be the Subject Matter Expert on it, but not the single point of failure either. If they're not training other members of a cross-functional team, that's wrong. 

But,  my title is ""Senior Solutions Engineer"" and not ""DevOps Engineer"". My role is to build that system (including all of those things) while training those other members of my team and other teams how to ""do devops, cloud, agile, scrum"". There's backing from the C levels and upper management on this, so I don't have that culture problem. But even so, a huge portion of my work focuses on the culture, which is usually the biggest problem. I'm just expected to be the expert on it.

Which again, is awesome.

I would probably leave if it was like that other situation though. There are definitely good organizations that are either doing DevOps right, or at least trying to and are open to it.",0,0.9726521203856106

> ...My dad is a dentist running his own practice. He employs a secretary, hygienist, and dental assistant. Under some sort of ""DentOps"" movement, my dad would be making appointments and cleaning people's teeth while trying to find time to drill cavities, perform root canals, etc. My dad can do all of the other jobs in his office, because he has all the specialized knowledge required to do so.

> But no one, not even all of his employees combined, can do his job.

The difference is, his dentistry skills don't actually make the secretary obsolete. He can't replace his secretary by taking a dental drill to his appointment book once a week. If he could, would it really be worthwhile to employ a full-time secretary to do all those appointments manually?

Or to put it in more concrete terms: If his secretary could be replaced by [something like this](http://www.acuityscheduling.com/), why would he want to deliberately do things the less efficient way?

If you think DevOps just means your developers also ssh into servers and restart Apache, you're Doing It Wrong.

Why aren't you getting into it? Do you want to? Do you have questions? Let's chat, let's compare notes, let's help each other.","Some people are fans of things like ansible where you describe how systems are _built_, in terms of order-of-operations instructions. This is not the ideal way to do this from a DevOps perspective.

Instead, you want to have CI/CD pipelines (I'll explain this in a sec here), and you define systems in that ""this is what I want it to look like"". Think about a yaml file (this is a style of a feature-rich config text file) which literally describes the parts of the system you want defined, and parameters for configuration. You want to use $thisdockerimage, and you want it to mount this share to this folder, you want to set these environment variables to these values, you want to use these launch parameters, etc.

Once you have defined the yaml file, the concept is that then the CI/CD pipelines detect the new yaml file (or that it has changed), and applies it to the environment. Which either creates new systems (for example, kubernetes/k8s pods/services/whatever) within your environment, or reconfigures existing systems to match changes you made (let's say you're changing parameters for something you've already defined).

This is tangibly different from an ""ansible playbook"" style, where in that regard you define the steps to create it, but in this way you define what you want it to look like and your environment automates making that happen.

A CI/CD pipeline is Continual Integration/Continual Delivery. Continual Integration talks about regularly ""commiting code"" to the repo, in that you make lots of ""small"" changes, frequently, instead of big lumps of code as releases (think, major version #). So you make some changes to an existing yaml file, or commit one or a few new yaml files, and that's Continual Integration, instead of one big massive **** of a project. Continual Delivery is the automation of implementing these things as commits/merge requests/merges happen. Whether it's compiling software and rolling out a new application you're developing, or pushing a k8s yaml file to reconfigure a system, the Continual Delivery is that automation.

SWE, SRE, DBA, SysAdmin, NetEng, Sec are being fed into this meat grinder of ""DevOps Engineer"" with a single cost category and set of responsibilities that is globally competed on.

A TL;DR of the tech industry is very smart people innovate and then salesmen latch on for monetization. This is good in balance, but left *unchecked*, this degrades the service and drives the utility into the ground. Sales vs engineering turns from symbiotic to parasitic. This was true with the invention of the internet (ARPANET such a great invention) that was subsequently [spammed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming#History) with the first unsolicited advertisements that opened the flood gates for **** **** emails. This degrading of the service in the name of monetization is true for much of tech including digg, Reddit, Myspace, FB, X, Airbnb, Uber, fake news, etc etc. To maintain the utility of the service it has to be **checked** (i.e. email filters and moderation) otherwise people move on.

Unfortunately DevOps doesn't have anyone looking out for the original utility of it, it doesn't have any checks or moderation, no glue to keep it to its core principals. The founding members moved onto DevSecOps, platform engineering, publications on AI, now chasing the next cash cow, and has left DevOps with the wolves in charge. Management only wants to hear the ""increased velocity"" and ""reduced time to market"" side of the coin that was sold to them without any investment into the people or culture.

As an engineer in this space, you have constantly changing tooling below you and constantly changing interpretation by management above you. Drawing back to internet history, our email inbox is getting spammed with **** **** ads and we haven't invented email filters yet. Doing well in this space requires a lot of adaptability, ability to spot ****, and influence the environment around you.

A person doing DevOps needs to have a solid understanding of both fields (Dev and Ops), which are vast by themselves already.

The problem is, a good developer will probably want to keep developing and not fiddling around with Grafana dashboards for 30% less money. The non-classic definition of DevOps as a commucation position between development and operations, which tends to include CI/CD, deployment, networking and security, drives this point home, since it's even harder to find someone willing to do all of this.

No, I don't believe DevOps has that philosophy. I haven't seen it in any writings from any of the people who first created the term nor espoused the practices or culture of DevOps.

I believe the aim is for everyone to understand the various problems that can happen along each step of a software development lifecycle, and for each role to understand what they each need to do to prevent those problems. That involves learning new ways of working, and new ways of collaborating. But it doesn't require anybody learning anybody else's job.

It's like home construction. A framer doesn't need to know how to be a plumber. But they do need to understand how to frame in such a way that they're not making the plumber's life worse. And the plumber needs to know how to plumb in such a way to prevent problems for other tradesmen. Otherwise, the end result could be a real mess of a house.

Given a fairly decent chance I'm fairly sure you'd be able to get someone who'd manage to get the ball running fast


Atleast for me, the answers for these would be:
1) a ""client"" requests a port from their OS, (if its a hostname) then it does a DNS lookup to get the IP address, opens a TCP or UDP connection to the destination server, does the negotiation and begins sending the request/data when the ports writable 

2) Common ports would be the ports that are standardised. People know what they're used for since everything uses the same one. E.g. HTTP on 80, HTTPS on 443, SSH on 22 etc

3) ps -ef to see what's running and if u can spot anything unusual, top to see if something seems to be using too much. iotop to see if maybe its Disk IO being used too much

4) This is really just an extension of 1 right?
5) firewalls, not my thing. IIRC, the stateless comes in from how the packets are read or something and then firewalling happens based on that. 

6) Web server, again an extension of 1 but in reverse. I get it, but perhaps choose a different question? But I digress, opens a TCP socket in listening mode. Waits for the client connection from 1, when it receives a requests it typically kicks it off to another worker to take over the receiving socket, handle, (and depending on HTTP KeepAlive, close it or keep open)

7) df -h 
8) DNS? I guess I see the point of this one. Essentially a server with a database of records of different types. A goes to an IP, CNAME is an alias etc. When it receives a request it responds with the requested record 

9) How terraform works, this is a godawful question. It uses ""providers"" to connect to infrastructure providers. And they provide datasources to read data/hardware/resources and resources which allow to create/modify/destroy those items. And all of this is tracked in a state file so that you can start on a fresh account and spin up an exact replica of what was deployed to the 1st acc.",20,1.0

I think that's a bit off too.

The real goal of devops, like agile, is organizational. It's about integrating development and operations efforts and creating tighter feedback loops.

If you're still siloing your developers and operations away from each other or you've got ****/them attitude between your devs and ops, then the company has fundamentally missed the point.

It's frustrating because agile and devops are both very real, important concepts, but the whole point is that they *require organizational change*, which is hard.

Things are overly complex a lot of times now because people follow trends and often management dictates what technology has to be used. I'll give you an example. My first configuration management system consisted of shell scripts for each host type, and if a specific host needed unique configuration it would have its own script based on the original scripts. All of this was kept in files with configuration first in a master file and later MySQL. Configuration of a host took seconds. Updates to all hosts, for example rollouts, took about 30 minutes. The files were all under change control (this was before git) on a single host. I left the department and moved on to data analytics, but years later had to contribute again. Everything had moved to puppet because management south of the border demanded it. Rollouts took hours upon hours, sometimes there would be days worth of meeting to figure out how to manage some weird setup we had with Puppet. Every new person had to be trained to use all of this infrastructure as well. I'm not sure how much we benefitted from it. Last I saw, they were moving to containers etc. from the VMs we had been using, which is good, but the provisioning script was hundreds of thousands of lines of code with contributions from probably a dozen people and dependencies all over the place. Deployment of a simple lab took about an hour and was not stable. I don't see any real thought being put into requirements these days... I'm sure this is true in many places. Also the costs that I saw for some technology was ridiculous.  The companies that succeed will simply have to look closely at what they are doing and focus on the core requirements. Someone can tell me I'm wrong if they have more experience and have developed something that isn't overly complex and prone to failure.",12,0.6850188076481243

While DevOps can bring about numerous benefits, organizations often face several challenges during the transition. Here are common challenges and strategies to address them:
1. Cultural Resistance:
Challenge: Resistance to cultural change is a common obstacle. Siloed teams may resist collaboration, and there may be a lack of understanding or buy-in for DevOps practices.
Addressing Strategy:Leadership Support: Secure support from leadership to foster a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.Education and Training: Provide training sessions and workshops to help teams understand the value of DevOps and its impact on their work.
2. Communication Barriers:
Challenge: Ineffective communication between development, operations, and other stakeholders can hinder collaboration.
Addressing Strategy:Cross-functional Teams: Encourage cross-functional teams that include members from development, operations, and other relevant departments.Communication Tools: Implement collaboration tools to facilitate communication and transparency.
3. Legacy Infrastructure:
Challenge: Legacy systems and infrastructure may not be conducive to DevOps practices, slowing down the adoption process.
Addressing Strategy:Incremental Changes: Implement changes gradually, starting with less critical systems.Automation: Invest in automation tools and practices to modernize and streamline legacy processes.
4. Lack of Automation:
Challenge: Manual processes can slow down development and introduce errors.

8. Resistance to Change Management:
Challenge: Teams may resist changes to established workflows and processes.
Addressing Strategy:Change Management Practices: Implement effective change management practices to ease the transition.Collaboration and Involvement: Involve teams in the decision-making process to gain their input and address concerns.
9. Skill Gaps:
Challenge: Teams may lack the necessary skills to adopt DevOps practices effectively.
Addressing Strategy:Training Programs: Provide training programs to enhance skills related to automation, collaboration, and other DevOps practices.Cross-Training: Encourage cross-training among team members to build a broader skill set.
10. Undefined Success Criteria:
markdownCopy code- **Challenge:** Without clear success criteria, it's challenging to measure the impact and success of DevOps initiatives. 
- **Addressing Strategy:** 
  - **Define Clear Goals:** Clearly define goals and success criteria for DevOps initiatives. 
  - **Regular Assessments:** Regularly assess progress against predefined goals and make adjustments as needed. 
Overcoming these challenges requires a holistic and gradual approach, involving continuous improvement, clear communication, and collaboration across teams. Organizations should tailor their DevOps adoption strategies based on their unique context and challenges.",0,1.0

Maybe rent out for cheaper price than market for friends in maybe 2 years if I manage to buy one for me of the houses they're gonna build (cheaper than on the existing market). 

I think one of the things we don't learn early enough in life is that due to interest stacking your money early in your life is worth more than later in your life to some extent. So saving money (not cents but larger amounts) early can lead to profits in later down the line given enough time (e.g. 100$ saved now is 670$ in 20 years with 10% interest). If I knew this 7 years ago I'd have put the part I didn't need for college into a few etfs and probably borrowed max (against 0% interest with payback time 15 years!).

You are on call as a SRE,  and getting buzzed all the time with non issue alerts so much lately that you loose the sensitivity to it. However, when the real issue happens, you are expected to be alert and address it pronto. In my humble opinion, this donkey work  of identifying a needle in the heystack should just be left to machines, not humans. We should focus on more creative things, such as bringing in these agents and tweaking those. That would be the new face of SRE with AIOps in the tow.  

Enter agentic workflows 

1. Agent X is a piece of intelligent software (yeah, you could call it (not him/her) a purpose built model) which will be constantly looking at the observability data (metrics, traces, logs). It has mugged up all the patters and also understand the desired ideal state of the system. It knows whats an issue and whats noise. Anytime it detects the abnormal pattern and drift from desired state, it would raise an alarm and call to agent Y, who is  troubleshooter. 

2. Enters Agent Y, who is now called on to the job of finding out the Root Cause if the issue. It has deep knowledge of Systems and is at expert at RCA and correlating the data. It knows common issue, its probably also has scraped and mugged up the entire stack overflow. It quickly detects that there is an issue with a specific node, or a pod and so on and so forth. And then it calls to agent Z, the fixer. 

3.  Agent Z wakes up and come into action to mitigate the issue. It knows the 5 ways to fix xxxx (replace **** with anything) and it can also dynamically figure out the best way to fix the issue with the least amount of disruptions, as its been trained to do so.  Its quickly fixes the issue and communicates back with the team. 

4. There is ofcourse a supervisor looking after the team, cor ordinating and communicating with everyone, making sure things are in order. 

  
All this data will be fed back into the system, in true blameless postmortem, as machines dont have the ego issues and trying to pass on the blame. They know that their job would be easier the next time if they just focus on learning from what happened here and create a plan for future if something like this happens again.

They generally expect users to do the control character escaping, in several different obscure formats. Did I say escaping? I meant three layers of nested escaping!Variable/macro substitution as a rule uses syntax that overlaps with either PowerShell, Bash, or both because otherwise it would be too easy.Another basic thing is the absence of a debugger — I have to run a complete pipeline with a change to dump out environment variables!Instructions contain the display names of paths, scripts use the variable names, but the output (and errors!) use the values with no clear mapping backwards. What the eff is C:\s\1\x? I dunno, but it caused an error!The worst sin is not having a local development experience where the entire pipeline can be run without having to commit code and push stuff almost all the way to production. Even if the pipeline agent is made available, it’s useless without the underlying VM image which is huge and not easily obtained. Not to mention KMS/KeyVault and other similar services on which pipelines can depend.Developers complain about having to do DevOps, but in my opinion the problem isn’t who is doing it, but how. The tooling is just so bad, so very very bad, that anyone would hate it if they were the ones forced to do it. I’m an ex-dev-now-SRE and I hate it.",22,1.0

- Early-access / beta / experimental features; if people have the ability to opt-in to features that aren't fully settled.
- Canary deployments that handle a subset of requests for load testing. Canary deployments can be closely monitored for misbehavior or increased failure rates, so changes can be reverted quickly.
- Change scope limiting, to limit the impact of a bum change. This dovetails with opt-in and other forms of feature-flagging.
- Feature flagging, a form of change scope limiting. Code can be ensured to be structurally compatible, even when operationally inert. This helps prevent code drift, which reduces unanticipated integration headaches when trying to finalize and release.

It's going to be around for a very, very, long time, more than likely. It's huge in the city that I work in. .NET actually makes it really easy to be productive and deliver apps to market very quickly. Not only that, but MSFT finally got their thumbs out of their collective arses and embraced things like REST and JavaScript. They're really cross-platform compatible in the web services world. They've done a lot in the past few years starting with Windows2k8 and on to really re-gain relevance in the server space. 

But, specifically what made that company move to Windows was a couple of things: They didn't have a great experience with the Linux devs they had. The original product was on a LAMP stack with Perl, and it was really hard to find talent for that. 

I don't think they really ever got beyond having to hand-tweak config files for different environments, and everything in those environments were so different, they didn't really automate deployments. But, not being able to find people to develop for it was really getting to them. 

So that was one part of it-- .NET developers are still hard to find, but easier to find than Perl guys around here. But, as we started to branch out to more and more clients with our new product (healthcare was our marketspace, but I can't go into detail about what the product was), most hospitals already had a strong Windows 2k3/2k8 infrastructure, and they wanted us to integrate with that. They wanted to use AD permissions to be able to administer our system, and they wanted the core app servers to be directly on their domains for management purposes. ",19,1.0

Troubleshooting was horribe. Each team during incidents: “Network is fine”, “web has no issues”, “linux is ok”, “database is cool”. These days, a single person can easily install and operate the entire stack with terraform and kubernetes. Abstracted, sure, but no more silos. You need to know high level DNS, Storage, routing, TLS, Linux to do your job but you really have the power to quickly troubleshoot the entire stack if you do know it.

For example, teams who (still) won't invest in automated testing.

A tool called cucumber and then all our problems are solved?!!"" - again, focusing on the believe that a tool will solve the problem when it's the team that needs to start writing tests as they code).

well, yes, they are endless one offs.  policies have their place, but in general (except for user access) you want your apps to be scoped down to least privilege.  we don't allow anything except inline policies or Amazon managed policies.  if you don't want to go down to app/service level, it's usually reasonable enough to have a ""grouping"" of apps that share a role.

I’m American, but I’ve been living in London for a little over ten years. I have a chronic health condition, so without exaggeration I feel confident saying I know both healthcare systems reasonably well. 

Complaints about long wait times within the NHS drive me a bit mad. I won’t put the NHS on a pedestal and claim it’s perfect by any stretch, but unless you’re making _very_ good money at a company with _excellent_ health benefits, the NHS is so much better than the United States in nearly every way that matters. 

Unfortunately, my decade in London has coincided with a decade of Tory rule, and I’ve watched them intentionally and brutally gut the NHS through funding cuts and freezes in an unspoken but brazen attempt to encourage if not outright force the privatisation of healthcare in the UK. Billions of dollars that should be going to protect the health and wellbeing of UK residents are just gone, and it’s negatively affected the system at every level. It was so much better when I first arrived here: now it feels like every doctor is stretched to their limits and facilities are perpetually overwhelmed. 

As much as the Tories will doublespeak otherwise, this isn’t a failure on the part of NHS staff, nor is it indicative of an innate flaw in socialised healthcare systems. It’s a hostile, malicious policy intended to open the door to an alternative system where private companies can turn a profit from people’s suffering. 

The NHS doesn’t need a major overhaul. It needs the resources it’s been denied for more than ten years. This can be fixed at the ballot box.",7,1.0

And pick containers from [this list](https://fleet.linuxserver.io) that you find interesting.
2. Don't fixate on the title, DevOps will pay more than even Enterprise Sys Admin hands-down. You will love the work so much more, the work/life balance is superior, systems are substantially more reliable and faster. What's not to love?
3. What is your concern about remote work? This is how you're going to make more money, you won't have interruptions to your productivity (like open-office concepts, or people coming and distracting you with face to face conversation). You'll still be able to engage people like on Slack or whatever in realtime, but on your terms, instead of people interjecting. There's other benefits too, like just going downstairs to get a snack, or not having to waste half or more of your lunch time just finding food, or not having to spend so much time commuting. But yeah, remote opens up very large amounts of job opportunities and pay scales, and with DevOps the market is THIRSTY.
4. DevSecOps is a worthwhile thing to aim for. If you want to start to see what that can look like, go read up on DAST and SAST automation in CI/CD pipelines, that's not all of it but a good chunk of it. Plus another is OWASP ZAP docker website scanning automation (something I'm working on currently).
5. You're not abandoning your experience, you're building on it. Also, Linux is a big thing, be comfortable with that.

I've actually learned this while at GOOG, not in startups, and I think GOOG was actually the company that championed the model at scale.

NoOps/DevOps means different approach to architecture and design. 

It means that software is written to embrace failure and survive, rather than rely on humans who are paid to not sleep at night.

It means defense-in depth style security, as opposed to building walls and organizations built around duty separation.

It means that devs are aware of production architecture and dependencies they are taking (don't know how to use a database? You shouldn't be putting it in your design). They know how much RAM and CPU cores are in their servers, and so they can target the right hardware, and not a mythical 2GB box.

In short, dev ops means that all problems are solved by software, and by engineers - who a software company KNOWS how to interview, hire, and grow, as opposed to ops, where I have no clue how to distinguish good ones from the bad ones.

When implemented this way (and for instance, GOOG does), IT WORKS. IT WORKS GREAT. And don't let a two-bit online pundit tell you otherwise.",0,1.0

IT and software exists in most companies to deliver value to other lines of business such as greater manufacturing efficiencies, patient outcomes (ok, this is sarcasm because basically no company gets more revenue for better patient outcomes in the world), etc. rather than being faster at delivering reliable features in software, for example. This is part of why so long ago the whole “digital transformation” trend cooked up by a bunch of people was popularized for a while where these incentives were supposed to better align with whatever existing business culture or processes were in place, but it never materialized into much because most companies that are fairly large now in their respective markets basically are only competing against themselves because larger organizations are better able to simply choose their markets and customer base and thus are in little immediate need to innovate or improve based upon the crude figure of something like share price. Innovations may lead to increased revenue and share value and all that, but culturally most organizations basically don’t have the existential drivers such as how start-ups need to keep innovating or collapse quickly to make these changes.

To more directly answer the question of why companies don’t spin these out my best guesses are that there’s both legal and technical reasons. Most organizations don’t want to send out software to anyone else because it’s a write-down and they’re not staffed to handle the software community’s input much. Heck, even highly technical organizations oftentimes don’t do this (see: id Software with its world-class game engines not wanting to license it out because they couldn’t support licensees well). On a technical level a lot of the software produced is frankly quite garbage and of little value to the world, much of my own code included absolutely.

But this is why I’ve given up on working in SRE / devops for organizations where their business is not aligned at a high level closely to delivering higher quality software. It doesn’t matter if you have great executives above you if their own power within the organization will be capped far below someone else unaligned with technology that will keep hampering your superior’s noble, valiant efforts. This is the primary reasons cited when people quit from under me before - it wasn’t about me as a manager / leader but about the n levels above me that kept me from enabling my team to work at their hired skill levels and expertise.",8,1.0

I believe for instance that Continuous Delivery in general is something that is hugely undervalued in this regard. Sort of obvious I have this opinion as I work in this space but I truly believe this. This is how I think about this: 

A well tuned Continuous Delivery setup, either self-scripted or “as-a-Service” is much more the “glue” in a teams toolchain:

* It allows all the different components, from source control system to CI-Pipeline, from database to cluster and from DNS setup to IaC to be integrated into a streamlined and convenient developer experience.
* It’s a way to structure, maintain and manage the growing amount of yml and configuration scripts. If done well this allows your developers to dynamically spin up environments with the artefacts built by the CI-Pipeline and fully configured with databases provisioned and everything set up.
* It can act as a version control system for configuration states with an auditable record on what is deployed where, in what config and it allows you to roll back and forth as well as manage blue/green/canary deploys. 
* Well thought through CD setups have a game-changing effect on developer productivity. They make developers self-serving with less dependencies within the team while increasing maintainability of your setup. ",24,1.0

Especially since you said that you had ""Switched from a Linux shop to a Windows shop"".

The product we primarily delivered through Linux. Sorry if I sound like I'm changing my story or something. That's not my intent. 

>Did your admins -- I notice you call them ""ops"" and quite frankly that's a mark against your favor -- have compartmentalized workflows within their department? Or did you even know whether that was the case?

Care to enlighten me on what I'm doing wrong in this? I mean no offense, certainly. They were technically both admin and ops, really-- they pretty much had complete dominion over... ""the servers"", at least the ones that we used to deliver service to the clients. They administered the boxes, and they also were responsible for managing installation and patches to the product running on the hardware, too. That, to me, says that they're both admin AND ops. Am I wrong? 

>Are you really that ignorant? If so, I am just **** floored. If not, why are you being this disingenuous?

I think that's a bit out of line, friend. I interacted with these people daily and saw what their workload was. The under-utilization wasn't always because they'd ""automated themselves out of a job""-- that would have been awesome. There was one guy who did a **** of a job with things like Kickstart and locking things down. He was worth his weight in gold, but the other guys kind of rode on his coat tails. Most of these guys were basically Linux power-users who would have to consult a manpage as much as I would have to do anything in Apache. 

Bottom line: There wasn't a lot to do in this environment. The transition time provided *was* reasonable. They were provided resources to make the transition, and they should have just been augmenting skills they were already expected to have.  

How about explaining to me *why* you're floored, rather than being indignant? It's not like I'm trying to be a **** here. Explain to me what is unreasonable about the situation as I've described. It seems like I've omitted relevant details that could clear things up, or I do indeed have some misconceptions. ",-1,0.0

There is no easy way. That is the DevOps misunderstanding. To understand why, look at your car.Your car is a complex system that appears simple. You just purchase it, put gas in it, turn a key, shift a gear, press a pedal, and it goes. And goes, and goes, and goes. But over time the tires will go bald, the brakes will wear out, you will run out of coolant and brake fluid, the engine oil will turn to sludge, and the car will break down. Past those inevitable faults, some parts will randomly fail and require troubleshooting and replacement. You have two choices: either become a mechanic, or pay for one. (Or I guess. run it into the ground and buy a new one...) Computer systems are the same.Say you just want to ""buy and drive"". Ok, so you buy a PaaS. You still have to learn how to drive it. And they are only easy to drive up til the point they break down and need more maintenance. And that's just driving it...Now say you're in auto racing (building your own high performance, high reliability system). Someone has to build the car, someone has to maintain it, and someone has to drive it. You can't build a race car without knowing how to change a tire; otherwise you could build a car that runs like **** on the track. But mechanical engineers don't generally race cars, so they hand it over to mechanics and drivers to deal with running it on the track. And in doing so, they teach the mechanics and drivers all the insides and outs of the car. If they didn't, the car would never leave the garage, much less win a race. Imagine a random Ford mechanic or your cousin Bobby at the helm of an F1 car.People who build systems should know how to run them. However, if people building systems don't know how to run them, they must teach whoever is running them how it was built and how it works inside and out. If anything significant changes, the mechanics need to know. And if something fails on the track, or even some unexpected brake fade, the engineers need to know so they can redesign their parts.NASCAR, Formula 1, Le Mans, etc would be completely impossible otherwise. When the cars fail, the mechanics would be constantly shouting at the engineers pulling teeth trying to figure out how to fix the car in the middle of the race. There is no time for that madness. Toyota also builds their cars by having a continuous improvement cycle between engineers, the people assembling the cars, and service technicians. Toyota has basically been doing DevOps for 70 years (if you don't know the TPS system, you don't know **** about DevOps).When I was fixing my brakes the other day, I ran into eight different operations I need to do properly. I needed to use a breaker bar and torch to unseat stuck bolts, because banging a wrench with a hammer strips bolts (guess how I know). I needed to use a custom tool to push the caliper piston back for the rear piston, because it requires twisting to reseat rear pistons. I needed anti-seize put on the rotor and wheel hub surfaces to prevent them sticking the next time I remove them. I needed to remove the caliper slide pins, clean them of dirt, and re-grease them, to prevent uneven/premature brake failure. I needed to grease the brake pad slides as well as the caliper contact points (without getting any on the pad material). I needed to torque the bolts to the right specification (the front and rear bolts take different torque). I needed to bleed the brakes with a custom appliance to remove air bubbles from the lines. And I needed to properly bed the brakes. All of those operations are necessary to prevent failure. But if I'd never learned about all the failure modes, I would have just slapped it all together and the brakes probably would have failed soon after. (The brakes will still fail eventually, I just control how soon it happens)There is no getting around the knowledge gap. There is no easy way.

A good DevOps engineer should have in depth understanding of systems, networking, and a programming language or three.  There just aren't enough people like that to go around.  The industry has responded by developing an endless array of tools designed to enable individuals to learn ""the tool"" as opposed to understanding every underlying facet of the technologies involved.

Full disclosure: I am a tech exec most of the time. The problem with the argument for fixing tech debt is that it's not very convincing. You turn off the software factory to mop up your mess (which tends to be a career limiting move to begin with). Then, even in the rare cases where you manage to chip away at the tech debt, it's usually impossible to maintain it at a low level. Usually, it's a better ROI for your effort is simply to keep any child-eating symptoms at bay, wait for a good reason to do a greenfield rewrite and then simply walk away and \*don't pay\* the tech debt.

If you are developing with any ""agility"" you will lapse in documentation.  Typically developers teams are larger than support and QA teams and there is no way they will be able to keep up.  If you have developers that are writing bad code, there is no penalty for it otherwise.  Having developers doing support helps them learn the code base as well.  It's a also a very good way to encourage writing more tests so that frequently breaking code is protected.

If you don't have developers doing releases, they don't know the pain that can come about.  We can't do production releases but all of our other environments are deployed identically.  

I was never one to shy away from learning as many things as possible.  I think it's been a definite advantage in my career.

:P

>pushing a patch every time dev wants to see if something works.

But I don't think this is what a responsible dev team asks for. I mean, a good dev team also doesn't just deploy some experimental code to production to see if something works, do they?

The idea is that dev tests their code together with all dependencies locally first, then on a dev staging server, then a branch is made, the whole thing (code + dependencies) is set up on a beta/QA server and finally when there's sufficient confidence that everything works is it deployed to production.

What we have is basically a pipeline where the product that we develop and comes out of it is seen as a combination of the JVM + AS + EAR (application archive). Depending on what has changed during a sprint what we deploy to production is either a ""full deploy"" (all above mentioned element) or a ""medium deploy"" (JVM + EAR or AS + EAR) or finally a ""small deploy"" (just the EAR).

Part of this is that we build the AS from source. If we only need a patch update of JSF (say Mojarra 2.1.26 instead of Mojarra 2.1.25) we build the entire AS again and the result is an artifact with an incremental version (e.g. GlassFish-3.1.2-our_company-3 for our third build of GlassFish 3.1.2).

Perhaps needless to say a new build of the AS goes through the same automated test suite that's being used if only the application code was changed.

With this setup there are no negotiations and begging sessions needed with an ops team. The output of a sprint is what's deployed and that's it ;)",22,1.0

Who cares, you're not gonna configure that kind of stuff anymore? Learn to use the service you bought for it.

>how a web server works under the hood

My answer to this one would be ""Could you please explain how transistors work and how they form a CPU. In the modern era this is about as relevant as this question""

>how to check disk space / free mem on a Linux machine (?!?!???)

Again, are you looking for a DevOps engineer or a sysadmin? Nobody really cares about (free) memory on linux. If a pod gets oom-killed go to the developer. If you need extra storage, just configure it and follow the line in your monitoring. We neither got the time nor the crayons to do this by hand

>how DNS works (?!?!?!?)

DNS is a commodity. 

>the different record types and their purpose

If you need it, you google it. 

>how terraform works

I don't care how it works, as long as I can use it. Surprising few people know how a combustion engine works, while being perfectly capable of driving a car. The same for a battery charger. Care to explain how one works, or would you rather use one?

I guess seeing the rant in your post you might have better luck with a relic sysadmin nearing his retirement. than a DevOps engineer. Broaden your horizon",20,1.0

Yes automation is crucial, but simplicity is usually better. It's better to have simple documentation/runbooks that are easy to understand than to have over engineered automation that makes the one task easy but requires maintenance and incurs tech dept. 

2) Over-modularization.  Splitting your code to be composable can be good, but keep in mind it can hide complexity. Remember that simplicity is key, so when in doubt, KISS. 

3) Not reflecting (I might be stretching to fit this as an anti pattern, but it's important). After every success and failure, you should take a bit of time to look back and be honest about what went well and what didn't. Try to ask yourself ""why?"", and try to be honest about your own mistakes. 

The reason reflection is crucial is it will help you grow and discover these anti patterns first hand. The two I mentioned above were leaned there hard way. Reflection brought me to the point that I can deeply understand why these are anti-patterns. 

Understanding the ""why?"" also leaves me open to changing my mind in the future. Maybe a future advance in the field makes my advice obsolete. Always be ready to adapt or you'll become an old curmudgeon greybeard (rather than a wise sage greybeard).

It describes exactly what’s encompassed by DevOps without ever needing to say it outright. It also provides high level descriptions of “platform” and SRE, in a way that makes them much easier to discuss.

Convince others in your org to read the book and you’ll establish a common vocabulary, so everyone can concentrate on efficiently shipping software instead of throwing **** over walls and waiting for the next fire.

Follow-up: They have a website too, although it has “bonus” content like $$ video courses and stuff. I haven’t tried it because it’s expensive, and the book is plenty descriptive for teams that are already successfully practicing DevOps methodologies. If you’re struggling in a larger org or have a lot of clueless coworkers I could see the value though.

I'm mostly relaying second-hand information, since I've never been myself and can't judge.

it's coming from an extensively-traveled upper-middle class lady in her 50s, so YMMV.  What's important to her may not be what's important to a single 25 year old, or a 40 year old with a family.  She also misses her home in Kiev, so a lot of her perception is coloured by that.

According to her:

* Food variety kind of sucks
* Most restaurants are lower quality than many other countries
* Very little ethnic/authentic food, most of the selection is local to Balkan and Central/Eastern European food.  Not much for things like Indian, Malaysian, Japanese, Mexican, etc, and whatever exists is not very authentic

For another example, I'm generally not a fan of Canadian food options (Europe has way better food quality and selection), and she generally agrees with me on this.  She rates Canada significantly above Bulgaria, and I'm not even in a major city.

> You get affordable healthcare, education and public transport.

* **** commie-block buildings in pretty much the entire city (and this coming from someone from Ukraine)
* Not much interesting architecture
* Parks, etc, near Sofia itself simply don't compare to ex-USSR and to richer EU countries
* Country itself isn't very digitized (i.e. you can pay with Apple Pay in most places in either Ukraine or Western Europe, while in Bulgaria most places expect cash).

Honestly though her biggest complaint was just a lack of good places to walk her giant dog, and that most people don't train their dogs properly, so they just kind of.. run around unsupervised and tend to be somewhat aggressive.

> Great holiday options, incl. Greece in 3 hours by car.

1. Utilize YouTube and find a free course on Linux.
2. Utilize YouTube and find a free cloud course.
2. Go through the Network+ training (you don’t have to get the cert. just understand the material).
4. Take a lite programming tutorial. You don’t need to be a principal engineer building the next IG. You just have to understand how application stacks and dependencies work.

Let's take a moment to feel the pain of their devops team","Hahaha I was working at a client and implemented some automated file transfer and processing stuff. When I implemented it, I asked my manager how he wanted me to document the fact that the cert was going to expire in two years (which was their IT / infosec policy maximum for a prod environment at the time). He said to put it in the release notes and put a reminder on his calendar.

Fast forward two years, I'm working at a different company, let alone client. Get a call from the old scrum master for that team. He tells me he's the new manager of the project, old manager had left a year prior. He informs me that the process I had set up suddenly stopped working, was giving them absolutely nothing in logging, and they tried everything they could think of to fix it but nothing was working. They normally wouldn't call someone so far removed from the project but they were desperate.

I decide to be the nice guy and help them out of the goodness of my heart (AKA a discounted hourly consulting fee). They grant me temporary access to a test environment (which was working fine). I spend a couple of hours racking my brain trying to remember the details of the project and stepping through every line of the code / scripts involved. Finally I see the test cert staring me in the face. It has an expiration of 98 years in the future. It occurs to me that we must have set the test cert for 100 years in the future, and two years had elapsed. That's when the ""prod certs can only be issued for two years"" thing dawned on me. I put a new cert in the test environment that was expired, and, lo and behold, it failed in the exact same way it was failing in prod.

Called up the manager dude and told him the situation. He was furious at himself for not having realized the cert probably expired. I asked him what he was going to do to avoid the problem again in two years. He said he was going to set up a calendar reminder... that was about a year and nine months ago. We'll see what happens in March :).",2,0.5041130443732909

A Lot of their issues sound like relevant issues, I mean DevOps has never been perfect. It's a long read, I'm not going to go point by point. However there was one point they made that stood out to me, the no-code example 


https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/module-design


The author claims to know terraform, or at least use it, yet fails to understand that the community has struggled with whether to use no-code modules for a long time. I mean in terraform now you can make no-code modules with nothing but an ""enabled"" var. However, it's been a struggle in deciding to do this practice because it goes against terraform declarative nature. Whats the point of terraform if you hide declarative configuration behind computed values and templates? you can't manage it day2 and then guess what your grimy hands are right back into the provider managing resources. More or less you lost the value add of terraform using no-code, I just said this to a company today ""anyone with multiple toolings, languages, clis, can simply make a vm, security group, vpc, eks, etc"". Building off that, the API dirven nature of the cloud providers is why it's so easy; they standardized on the protocol.


This beta feature of terraform cloud is literally just support for an existing pattern some people have used, it's nothing new, it's not a ""sign"". Hashicorp is giving a user interface (UI) to run one-and-done workspaces, which imo is an anti-patter.",-1,0.0

But there's a difficult barrier to pass to *actually* pay money for something, so it's unnecessarily discouraging to think in terms of profit. Also, a focus on profit can lead you away from usefulness - which is the where money really comes from.

Make something vaulable, and people will give you money for it.

The two issues in creating value are *unmet need*:

1. meets a need
2. that is not already met

### Need

Markdown export is a good idea. I actually looked for one of these myself, but the products were too big/complex for my needs. I could implement a super rudimentary one myself (`*italics*` to *italics*) with sed regex (though there's some complexity with multiline). There's actually a markdown interpreter in bash, a few hundred lines - though just to HTML I think. So... I ended up just using groff and the manpage format.

Further on markdown: I personally thought it would never take off in the mainstream, because wysiwyg is obviously so much better (I thought it would take off for programmers, who are used to working directly in HTML, LaTeX etc). So imagine my suurprise when it has massively taken off in the mainstream - e.g. in reddit, right here. Of course, the truth is, you can use reddit perfectly fine without ever touching markdown or even being aware of it, so the success of reddit doesn't really indicate the success of markdown.

More on markdown: I have heard of a couple of people writing books in markdown (on HN, I think). Of course, they are technical types.

As for the mainstream, WordPerfect used to use explicit markup (like markdown), and was utterly destroyed by Word's wysiwyg.

So, what is the need for a markdown (and for a markdown exporter)? I think it's technical people; and some mainstream people, who want to write books/articles - something involving a little markup, but not to much.

It might also be professionals writing technical manuals - or memos - within big corporations, journalists, academics (hence LaTeX). That is, not consumer but business/government (which has many arms: education,military, health care, civil engineering etc...). What's a need they have that isn't met? I don't know. But if you get something out there, you might find out... especially if you target their needs in other ways, but there's something missing then you may get an annoyed email ""why doesn't it do X!!?"" A problem is an opportunity.

### Unmet

I think the direct alternatives, of markdown exporters, is wide open.

You can test this by pretending you are wanting a markdown exporter, but don't have time to write one (as you have found, it takes some time to write one).

1. do you know of any already, off the top of your head?
2. google, using a few different terms.
3. ask people around you if they know of any.
4. post a question on SO, progit, HN.
  (you could also search github/SO, but the google (2) will pick them up)

How does your idea compare? Is there anything about the competitors that you really don't like, or can see an obviously better way to do it? (NB: I don't mean a better way to implement it, I mean better for you, as a user, to use it).

But there's another kind of competitor - alternatives approaches to what you're really trying to do. The really big alternative is Word. If someone was writing a book or article, why wouldn't they use Word?

Maybe because they are on linux, or a tablet. NOTE: tablet wordprocessors seems a woefully under-served market - the ones I've seen are terrible. (Even the android browser I'm using right now for writing this mini-""article"" is seriously buggy: especially, cut and paste is unreliable). Microsoft doesn't want Word for Android because it undermines their competing phone OS. This creates a competitive vacuum. People with only a tablet (or who use it more, because it's convenient) still want to use Word sometimes.

So, there's Google docs - that works on Android. But it's slow and (sorta) requires a network connection.

But the real thing you want is: people who *don't want* wysiwyg. Why would they not want it? Isn't wysiwyg better in every way A good place to start is why you yourself don't want it. Why do you want to use markdown? Why do you want to edit in one place, and view the result elsewhere? (like editing HTML directly, or using LaTeX)

### Conclusion

Why do all the above? To determine if what you want to do is *valuable*, in terms of some body, with some task in some situation. It might not be valuable, or the best thing in every way, in the abstract, but it doesn't need to be. It just needs to be vaulable *to someone*. Knowing who that is enables you to communicate its valuableness to that person, in a way that makes sense to them (using their terms, concept, and concerns). Very likely, *you* are one of those people, and so describing it in a way that would make sense to another you is not all that hard.

But unfortunately, the only way to actually know if it's valuable is to put it out there and see if anyone does think it's valuable! Hence, the ""minimum viable product"" so beloved of startups. Sounds like you already have one of them, if it's up on github - though is it actually usable yet? Is it easy or difficult to download/get started/install (for another you, *as a user*, not someone who wants to get their hands dirty - they just want it to *work*. As if they were on reddit, I guess). And most importantly, does it communicate why someone would want to use it?

But fortunately, none of this is a big deal. There's no risk (don't quit your job yet!). There's no deadline. There's no ego-loss/embarassment if it ""fails"" (do it as a gradual thing).

It's just a dispassionate experiment: I wonder, does anyone need this? It's nice to be right, if you think it *is* needed... and that can be a barrier (because it's unpleasant to be wrong, especially if you put a lot of work into it).

To finish up: I think markdown will become more important over time (but as a niche;  never take over fully from wysiwyg), since everyone uses it for social media. Especially on mobile devices - maybe partly because touch screens are a pain for precise highlighting? You do need a keyboard though. Certainly, mobile devices are taking over from PCs. (My present phone is actually more powerful than my present PC in some ways) The competition is wide open.

In the past this has meant people messaging me saying they are blocked because their dockerfile fails in CI. Then you walk through it with them and it’s also broken locally and it comes down to them pinning to something like latest tag and the image “shocker” changed. But now you  are fixing it and after you go remind everyone that you should pin your image to as strict as possible image tag. But no one cares because they can move fast and break things and when it does blame it on CI and now it’s not their problem.Anyway this is just one tiny example but the same underlying thing starts happening in all parts of the development cycle. “My deploy doesn’t work” … well your program has an error and crashes on startup but looking at the logs would be too much work. Let’s just say we are blocked and log off.As you can see this is a culture issue but it seems to be common when you have a devops team. And even more common when management (read senior management and up) think that developers “should just be developing”.Anyway thats my rant.,0,0.9330459566346243

Let's take a moment to feel the pain of their devops team","When you’re talking about the authentication service layer for something the size and scale of Google, it’s not just “a set of distributed servers”. 

Geo-located DNS resolution, DDoS prevention, cache and acceleration all sit in front of the actual service layer. Assuming their auth stuff is a bunch of micro services hosted on something like k8s, now you have hundreds (if not thousands) of Kubernetes clusters and their configs and underlying infrastructure to add to the picture. 

At the code level, there could have been a botched release and rollback didn’t flip correctly, leaving **** in a broken state. If they’re doing rolling releases across multiple “zones”, the bad deployment zones traffic could have overwhelmed the working zones, taking everyone out. Or the rollback tooling itself had a bug! (That happens more than you’d think). 

At the networking level, a BGP announcement could have whacked out routes, forcing stuff to go to a black hole. 

Or it could be something completely UNRELATED to the actual auth service itself and a downstream dependency! Maybe persistent storage for a data store **** itself! Or a Google messaging bus was down. 

Point is .... for something as massive and heavily used as Googles authentication service, it’s really just a Rube Goldberg machine.

—EDIT—

For what it’s worth, Azure AD also had a very brief, but similar issue this morning as well. Here is the RCA from MSFT. The issue was related to storage layer, probably where session data was stored. 

Again, Rube Goldberg. 

=====•

Summary of impact: 
Between 08:00 and 09:20 UTC on 14 Dec 2020, a subset of customers using Azure Active Directory may have experienced high latency and/or sign in failures while authenticating through Azure Active Directory. Users who had a valid authentication token prior to the impact window would not have been impacted. However, if users signed out and attempted to re-authenticate to the service during the impact window, users may have experienced impact

Preliminary root cause: 
We determined that a single data partition experienced a backend failure.

Mitigation: 
We performed a change to the service configuration to mitigate the issue. 

Next steps: 
We will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.",2,0.6494058549521078

We can offer a number of other methods, but if their other systems don't support than and they don't want to pay for upgrades, SFTP it is. Not that I have anything against gobs of data arriving via SFTP for cleaning and importing¹ – it is tried & tested, reliable, and if both sides have a clue² it is easy & pain free. Much the same set of reasons they still want to send us CSV formatted data, often Win1252 encoded rather than UTF8, not JSON or something else better defined.> Just have them upload blobs to S3 or Azure Storage.The data is ending up in Azure storage in our case. But any transfer method still has identification and authentication matters to deal with, and they need to understand and their other software needs to support, the method chosen. This is why SFTP often wins by default: it is a relatively proven technique that people see as secure, and it is commonly supported.> The security is better and both are serverless solutions that cost basically nothing at normal scale.The cost to the client is only zero if their other systems already support it. They are very much against anything that implies extra development costs or the cost & effort of assessing and switching to newer systems.> PS: Azure Storage is multi-protocol and supports SFTP!SFTP support in Azure is a pretty recent addition, some time in this last year IIRC. We (well, I) had to put together our own relay arrangement some years ago: OpenSSH, appropriately locked down, with blob containers in storage accounts mounted via blobfuse). It works well, in nice cheap VMs/containers.SFTP support in Azure works out rather expensive for our use case, or any reasonable use case IMO. It needs the hierarchical namespace enabled though that is “only” an additional $27/month per storage account, but then you need to pay for SFTP support by the hour!³⁴ Unless we constrain the clients to sending data at specific times that comes to >$200 per month, per account. We can't get away with charging our smaller clients, or the bigger ones for that matter, an extra $2,400/yr nor can we afford to eat that ourselves. See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/calculator/ for reference.We could work around the per-account part by stuffing all the data into multiple containers in one account – but that would not fly with some of the requirements financial sector companies understandably have for data at rest, so we would never pass an audit if we did that. Many even want their live and UAT/training/other environments to have completely separate storage accounts so that is potentially more than one lot of up to $2,400 per year per client needing SFTP. And even on one account, $2,400/year to enable 24/7 availability of SFTP transfers is absolutely ridiculous.----[1] I'd rather it be cleaned first, but that is a separate issue[2] This part is, of course, the problem…[3] $0.30/hour: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/storage/bl...[4] No ****… https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/secure....",-1,0.0

Like we have (self proclaimed as well as normalized by job posts): Frontend Developers, Backend Developers, (And Full-stack developers if one can do both, or simply, Software Engineers), And infrastructure developers.DevOps, and especially with Pulumi / CDK (where it's actually infrastructure-as-actual-code and not infrastructure-as-a-JSON/Yaml file), is simply becoming a ""developer who also likes ops"" type of specialization. E.g. front-end, back-end and stack-end.The nice thing is, and what I try to do in my team (both at my current startup and previously at AWS) is to break the silo and keep the ""you build it you ship it"" notion. Frontend - TypeScript, Backend - TypeScript, Infra - also TypeScript. When an engineer wants to build a lambda that listens to SQS or a Fargate ECS task or an S3 bucket, they can just do it. I if you know how to use the AWS SDK to let's say read/write to S3/DynamoDB/SQS, the API to create S3/DynamoDB/SQS etc is not that far off, and if you are using CDK in TypeScript for example (whether it's Terraform / CloudFormation / CDK for k8s doesn't matter) then indeed the boundary between backend code and infra code is getting smaller and smaller (both technically and also visually, the declarative code to generate an S3 bucket in CDK is pretty **** close to how it will look to generate that same S3 bucket via the SDK, it's just that CDK takes care of idempotency / change sets / diffs etc...)In summary. I agree that DevOps should mean - you build it, you ship it and that the current industry trend towards a separate DevOps department is just plain wrong, but on the other hand, it's ok for specialization within a team, some will lean toward frontend, some toward backend, some toward data engineering, some toward data science, some toward security and some toward operations. Some will do a bit of both and some will prefer to focus and specialize, but I think that the main lesson I learned is that it all should be part of the team.

How would you like to automate something that you don't understand? In order to understand you have to have the necessary skills.
The necessity of analytic skills and the capability to continuously learn and improve is indeed a must, here you were right.

Not sure where Canada is coming from in your answer, but if 90k is average pay and not up to the cost of living, you have issues with the cost of living, not the pay range. Paraphrasing my initial comment: OP seems to complain about the absolute pay figure rather than the ratio between pay and cost of living, so he is assuming fixed cost of living. You seem to just have made the same mistake, but reversed. Salary range is not fixed, so varying living cost can only be compared to equal pay, which 90k is not, see my example of the Bay Area.

devops now just referes to IT... although with the difference that a devops eng has coding ability as opposed to a configuration grunt of days of IT past.

devops is responsible for deployment, monitor and management of all the infrastructure required to support the app and service of the business. developers will develop certain components of that service - but will never be responsible for the whole thing. Devops are on call to respond to alerts. If you're not on pager duty, you're likely not on the ""ops"" part of the team.

If you're going to have infra at scale, then you need to programatically manage that infra with a tight, small team. In our case, with thousands of instances running in the cloud, we are able to manage all that with three staff.

We work closely with the engineering teams in the design, development and deployment of their code. We write and manage launching of thousands of workers daily - scaling our servers with active users and load.

*THE GATING FACTOR BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION*

We own the definition of dev, test, stage, canary and prod.

We need to be able to talk with them about what their code is and what they are trying to achieve and work with them on brainstorming the best and most efficient ways to do that.

If you're planning on being a business - then you better be sure to have the ability to understand eery single aspect of youre infrastructure and how its all woven together and dependant upon each sub component - this will allow you to design it in such a way that you can decouple each piece in a reasonable manner as you grow - and as you grow to scale have teams dedicated to supporting just that component.

Look at a place like twitter where they have a devops guy (an SRE) dedicated to a single team of devs and who understands what they are doing and what they need so he can support their deployments in a CI way and understand what the normal perf of that deployment should look like after deploy....

if you get hung up on the term devops rather than understanding the value of the process and where production should be walled off from developers - then you're spending too much energy emotionally charged on the wrong thing...",0,1.0

Why aren't you getting into it? Do you want to? Do you have questions? Let's chat, let's compare notes, let's help each other.","1. I don't know what your current compensation is, but ""entry""/intermediate DevOps/similar roles (SRE, etc) are in the realm of $90k-$120k/yr (USD and/or CAD). How does that stack up vs your current compensation? And of course that is not including benefits and other nice things.
2. Don't let the ""#-#yrs experience"" get in your way, that's just a rough approximation of what anyone is looking for. What employers really care about is if you can do the job and can you learn. The better places to work care MORE about if you can learn, than whether you have the knowledge right now.
3. Homelab experience is absolutely relevant. Put that **** on your resume, refer to it in interviews, leverage it. There may be places that don't see value in it, but either you need to present it more effectively in interviews, or those places just straight up aren't worth working because they want ""cert checkboxes"", which really is not a good environment to live in.
4. Do not let the sunk-cost fallacy hold you back. Just because you have certs and such, does not mean advancing your career into DevOps (or anything else for that matter) is a mistake. DevOps/related builds upon your experience in areas, it does not inherently replace or discard it.
5. Again, Linux is bigger in this space than Windows, so be prepared for that. There are Windows DevOps roles out there, but AFAIK they don't pay as well as Linux, and there's more Linux DevOps roles anyways, so easier to get them based on numbers. But this is also your call to make, just letting you know.
6. Chances are, you may already have enough to get a job today. Update your linkedin, tune it for DevOps stuff, same with your resume, state you're open for new opportunities on your linkedin profile, chances are jobs will come to you. Explore those, and apply for job listings too. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to leave the job you have to just explore these things. ****, what's the worst that could happen, you get a job you like and pays you more? Oh noes, such trouble! And if nothing comes of it, well it can likely give you some more guidance as to where you may want to spend your efforts on growing your skills. I cannot stress this enough, the market is THIRSTY right now, get in on it!
7. I myself would not recommend going down Microsoft certs for DevOps, unless you're married to Windows. Windows or Linux, most places care more about your ability to troubleshoot, solve complex problems, learn, say ""I don't know"", stuff like that. Some places may care about those certs, but their value is short-lived.

I appreciate this detailed perspective and I do resonate with most of the aspects you outlined. 

My dissatisfaction stems from not utilising these many tools effectively, but the sheer need to maintain these many tools to ship a piece of code seamlessly.

Starting from your build pipelines up until your telemetry there is a tool that’s specifically built for it. And there is no single window / interface to manage, debug and effectively utilising these tools. Without that, the onus now lies on the developer / devops expert to orchestrate all these tools in an effective way and get better results. And eventually if these tools aren’t effectively configured, the outcomes will be subpar, leading to a direct impact on the stability of the application.  

I see that AWS is trying to bring everything under a single window, with CodeBuild, AWS Secrets etc to orchestrate the end to end, but even within AWS it’s fragmented and doesn’t feel like am dealing with a single unified tool. 

At the end of the day, it still boils down to have a DevOps expert who knows it all to effectively manage your infra, which bears the question of advancements and all these tools :(

No, that requires people to know other people's jobs. No way around it. For someone to be skilled and qualified enough to *understand* the various problems *and* how to prevent them is knowing other people's jobs. You can't understand problems and know how to fix/prevent them without intimate knowledge that comes from knowing the tools, systems, techniques, etc. very well in the majority of cases. And if you know them that well, you could likely work that job that uses them.

>A framer doesn't need to know how to be a plumber. But they do need to understand how to frame in such a way that they're not making the plumber's life worse.

Not really a good analogy as a framer can frame a house and never ever have to think about plumbing or what a plumber needs or will do. (I know, I was a framer when I was a teenager). This analogy is actually more akin to how things were always done prior to the DevOps philosophy. A framer would frame up a house and walk away without ever thinking about what a plumber was going to do or need, they just knew the plumber would come in and do their part next, aka devs did their part and handed off to operations.

You can think DevOps doesn't have the philosophy of an ideal where people are masters of both, but its principles absolutely lead to that. If you were to follow all the written out principles to their ultimate *best possible* outcome...that would be it. Master devs who were masters of Ops too so they understood all the various problems from both sides of the SDLC and could prevent those problems. 

But reality doesn't allow for that. Those unicorns are too rare so the compromise is DevOps teams where some cross the gap to a more limited degree and others remain masters of their areas.",-1,0.0

It's more of a tiny little opinion blog post rather than anything substantial. The author obviously has some issues with the way (in his experience) these terms have been used and applied and is venting about it. It didn't seem to hold all that much weight as there was no data to back up what he was saying.

Also, I have experienced first hand that developers are actually not capable of handling these jobs that are supposedly ""below"" them on the totem pole. Many developers never actually learn the skills required to be a DBA or provide application support proper. Their abilities in these arenas are the same as any other technically inclined person with some experience. That is to say, they're 'bottom of the barrel' options for most of these things because they don't understand infrastructure requirements, customer interaction or long-term side effects of certain decisions.

Frankly, I thought the article wasn't all that interesting. I was hoping for so much more based on the title because I do agree with the promise of the premise he set out. DevOps is something that can be powerful but should be strategically considered rather than just set as a base requirement because ""that's how we do things now"".

EDIT: In the business I work in we have a 40 man application support team comprised of four lines. The first two are investigate / identify / find immediate solutions teams. The latter two have additional duties for verifying and testing bugs, feeding back to dev and documenting new issues as well as providing alpha bug testing alongside our QA team. This way, customers get a voice through the application support team and devs get to work from a product management perspective.",-1,0.0

That is the problem. Nearly every company I have seen that has a ""DevOps Engineer"", their job description actually says, ""System Administrator that knows how to use git/Terraform/Ansible"". The better and more ""modern"" title for that is Cloud Engineer, but sysadmin still works if you have onperm stuff, but onperm and cloud are usually pretty similar nowadays. Just different Terraform providers/knowledge sets.

An actual ""DevOps"" role would basically mean Cloud Engineer/sysadmin (infrastructure, mostly ops) + SRE (alerting/APM/reliability, a bit more dev but mostly in between) + Platform Engineer (CI/CD + developer tooling, mostly dev). It is _way_ too broad of a role unless it is a really small team.  ""Fullstack"" roles are **** and are just a lazy way to mean ""we do not want to hire more specialized people"". Either everyone is bad at everything, or they are really only good at one thing and do not really care about the rest/do it poorly. 

Places often just say DevOps to mean Cloud Engineer and completely forget about the SRE + Platform Engineer parts. Either no alerting/APM tracking or very basic done by the sysadmins.

We earn slightly more in the US , but don't have any means to spend it on ourselves.

10 days vacation a year.  I use 5 days to get the week between christmas and new years off -- leaving me with 5 days to spread over the rest of the year for sick-days and PTO.   We get 6 paid holidays a year: New Years, July 4, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Day After THanksgivng, Christmas.

Health Coverage costs: I pay $500/month for insurance, which doesn't kick in until I spend at least $2000 in deductible in services.  At that point, it covers 60% of approved costs.    I'll spend between $15,000 and $25,000 a year to cover basic checkup, 3 urologist appoitnments, 3 sets of blood work, and general health (first colonoscopy was last Dec, cost was $3000 after insurance paid it's amount.

I rent a 600 sqft (55sqm) apartment, that's about a 1 hour commute from work.  The cost is $2600/mo.   It would be prohibitively expensive to live closer to the office.

An espresso latte, 200mL, costs $5.   Fruits and vegetables are expensive.  Apples, at the cheap grocery are $2.99/lb (EUR 6.10/kg).  I usually use one of the groceries in the town I live in, so they cost more.   A 12 pack of eggs here cost $5, though recently have been upwards of $7.   The bare essentials of food add up very quickly.

Company just announced cost-reduction layoffs. As they do every year.   You get zero notice, and you're fired.

Service costs are expensive.  A basic cell-phone, with 1GB data, costs $75/mo.   Internet 50mb down/5mb up is $90/mo.  Electricity bill doubled, again -- last month was $380.

(except to change the title of ""SysAdmin"" to ""DevOps Engineer""). ;-)

This is the sad reality for a lot of companies. I see lots of job postings for DevOps Engineers that describe what is essentially a system administrator job with the added responsibility of running CI/CD servers. Here's a hint: If you apply for a DevOps job and your team is not doing Development, run for the hills because DevOps is **Dev**elopment+**Op**eration**s**. i.e., ""you build it, you run it"". If someone else built it and you are running it, then you are just doing Ops (or SRE). There is no separate development and operations team in a company that is practicing DevOps, there is just one team which is cross functional.

One of the primary reasons for adopting a DevOps culture is to break down the silos. So, if the company you work for still has silos with hand-offs, (or even worse, they have created a 3rd silo between development and operations called the ""DevOps Team"") they are not doing DevOps! DevOps squads have end-to-end responsibility for what they commit, build, test, deploy, maintain, operate, everything!!! Of course there are different ways to accomplish this but the ""you build it, you run it"" mantra is at the core of DevOps.

SRE is a completely different philosophy where you maintain separate development and operations teams but one of the tools the ops teams has is a deployment gate (called an ""error budget"") with which they can control the flow of new deployments from development based on quality. SRE is a separate and distinct practice from DevOps. They have common goals but they achieve them in different ways.

It sounds like the jobs you have had are rebranded sysadmin jobs. That's unfortunate, but that's not DevOps.",0,0.9033513079449809

Why aren't you getting into it? Do you want to? Do you have questions? Let's chat, let's compare notes, let's help each other.","This is a valid question and a curious one to answer.

I would say the script itself and how it interoperates may not necessarily be itself DevOps. What would need to be additionally considered is how rapid your environment is setup for change and how tolerant of that change it is, and that includes recovery from failure.

Generally a script in and of itself isn't inherently DevOps, but when you make changes to that script and the environment automatically detects the change to the script, and then executes it, then that's getting close.

However, this sounds a lot more like the automation of the creation of systems, akin to Ansible, and not stateful enforcement in the sense that say Puppet or yaml/k8s operate. In that, you define how a system should look (puppet manifest, or k8s yaml file), save that definition somewhere (repo, network share, s3 bucket, wtvr), a component detects the change or new file and then applies it to the environment.

Just building the system in an automated sense is not necessarily DevOps in a fully realised regard. One of the big parts of it is rapid change, not just rapid deployment. Be it scaling up/down rapidly, or reconfiguring rapidly (changing how the system is defined without necessarily rebuilding it).

So, now that I've thought about it more, I would say it's getting close but not exactly DevOps.

Honestly I don't know SCCM well enough to know whether it does stateful enforcement in the ""proper"" sense.",-1,0.0

I'm guessing: a plug-in for a forum, so people can get a pdf of a nicely formatted comment (e.g. /r/science or a propriety closed forum). Or part of an internal corporate communications system - perhaps email (or might be implemented as a web ""forum"", just on an intranet). Great for drafting - their users can then transfer it to Word, or paste it into an existing document. Or, someone could distribute something on the internal forum, but a paper copy is needed for some reason... perhaps just to print out to look at, perhaps to satisfy corporate or governmental regulations, it has to be a pdf (with pdf security?)

So, you sell to the people who sell to the users. A library business model.

Note: it's hard to find these guys. What search terms would find them? But if you put up your library, with their needs met, then they google you.

Finally: I wouldn't worry too much about ""finishing"" it. Just make sure it usable and useful to *some* extent. How much markdown does it need to support to be useful? Even italics alone are useful! How many output formats do you need? HTML? latex Word pdf... Just *one* format is useful! Note that if people want more, they will tell you. This is advice from esr (for open source but same thing), all you need is:

1. promise of something really neat.
2. something that runs

You'll never actually ""finish"" it, there's always more you can think of (and it may be an excuse for not putting it out there...).

Not finishing is actually a good thing - when you have competitors who copy you, adding new features is a great way to stay ahead. But if you've already added them *all*... you're a sitting duck, and can only wait while you fate advances upon you.

There aren't many good devops engineers to begin with. Some of them I've worked with (I am one):

* don't know how to do basic **** in Linux
* write code like they just picked it up, without any guardrails or strict modes, without functions, without any readability... you complain that devops in EU have Indian pay, but the code they write is exactly the quality that we get out of Indian outsourcing. How can they expect to be paid better than the cannon fodder from India if they work the same?
* don't have the slightest clue what's a regular expression
* don't know more than 1 build system
* they need to be babysit by Senior and Expert devops because they can't figure out that if the customer asked them to give them a SUSE package, they just need to spin a SUSE Docker image and run a little changed up OpenSUSE recipe there - they cannot comprehend that similarities between systems can be used to an advantage if they can't be arsed to read the manual - oh yeah, they can't be arsed to read the freaking manual because they don't have time because they underestimated and underscored every task during their agile sprint, because they wanted to look good in front of management with an impressive list of things they promised they'll deliver

To put it blunt - if you don't run Linux as your main OS, and you don't program on the side to keep growing, and if you're just a tourist in the computer industry - you're not gonna make it.

Beyond that it's anyone's guess.

I've rarely seen a proper 2-pizza team with developers and infrastructure engineers as part of the same team. 90% of the time, DevOps is a separate team which manages the cloud. I've also rarely seen devops engineers participate in the sprint planning or product design process, meaning their expertise is left for the end when things need to be ""deployed"".

I think the main problem might be that while Agile is marketed to non-technical product managers and senior leaders, devops is still very much a tech thing and a sysadmin thing which most people don't care about.

Sorry for misreading that.

About 3-4 years ago, I was working for one of the biggest MSPs in my country, primarily as Senior Systems/Linux Administrator. I was trying to shake and hustle there, get into business development and big stuff, in addition to my day job. There came a point where one of the VPs there was working with me on new biz ops, and when I talked about DevOps, he latched on to that. I then proceeded to exhaustively go down that rabbit hole of concept so I could speak comprehensively on the topic in meetings with him (and others).

I requested the purchase of several books for the company library for me to also study and get into the topic, which was approved. Reading through The Phoenix Project gave me significant insight into realistic applications of DevOps and what it can look like. I also went through exhaustive, countless, online research on the topic. All sorts of online resources talking about it, and also this is where I observed the dichotomy of Software Development and Infrastructure Management.

As that year progressed I continued to work with that VP on working towards some new biz ops, including DevOps stuff at that MSP. So more continual study. Unfortunately there was a point where I was terminated without cause, they refused to tell me why, and any reasoning is irrelevant to this discussion.

Naturally, I needed a new job. While I was working an interim job a job prospect came to me for work that was effectively DevSecOps (but was pitched as Linux Admin/Automation). It was a 6mo contract for correcting IT Security issues that were reported to me/us (our team), and I would correct them with DevOps methods and technology. In this case this was Red Hat Satellite, and scripting automation.

Naturally, that contracted job came to the end of duration, and while they really loved my work, they were not able to get approval for renewal of me in-time, and I had to hit the bricks. Got the job I have now a few months later, and now I'm in an even more mature DevOps ecosystem, and have been continuing my education this whole time. In more recent history fleshing things out a **** of a lot more in my own homelab, roughly replication a good bit of what is at my current job (in terms of methods).

So that's a high level story of how I got into it.",0,0.8508526401910478

Some things to help you:

* Read Google's SRE book, Building Secure and Reliable Systems is great too

* Study Non-Abstract Large System Design 

* Check out talks from conferences like O'Reilly's Velocity 


If you are looking for experience in the field but don't have a ton of it, joining a consultancy company is also a great alternative to cut your teeth on, and are usually pretty open as long as you can talk the talk at the interview. Startups are good too.  You also may have a resume problem, since most people look for buzzwords, and headhunters/ 


syncing up with recruiters on LinkedIn is great too.  I.e. 

* put a bunch of buzzwords in your LinkedIn profile 

* update it frequently even just adding and removing a period to keep you at the top of the algorithm.  

* Add whoever sends you a connection request, LinkedIn is about finding jobs, and the job game is a lot about connections 

* A bunch of recruiters will contact you via messages, start working them for intros to other jobs if the job they have doesn't work for you.  ""Hey, thanks for contacting me, happy to talk about this job but I'm actually looking for jobs like Y to fit my skillset, can you help me find those?

You acknowledge the human limitation and the requirement of specialization. DevOps philosophy would have an *ideal* which would be a team of people who not only master development but also master operations. Clearly too rare and nearly impossible in real life to have people like that. 

The reality is more like what you describe: a dev having a cursory understanding of the systems and tools their app runs on while there still has to be those who specialize more in operations because the tools and systems get too deep. Ops having a cursory understanding of how Devs work and how the application runs so they supply the systems without much thought to advanced programming.

The catch is, that's how it's always been. That's not a new thing. Ops has been setting up systems knowing the general fundamentals of  software development all along. How do you think they built systems to begin with before the term ""DevOps""? Same from the other end. Most programmers have always known the general concepts how and what their apps run on. 

So we're back to this thing of what does DevOps really keep asking us to create? Well your original post says you're **** because teams have people with ""DevOps"" titles, but to me, that's the generalists who walk the line between the two helping the teams communicate while others on each side remain specialists because, as we've established, everyone can't achieve that DevOps ideal of mastering both. 

If we're sticking with cursory understanding of each others roles then, well, we're just back where we were before DevOps was coined. At least having DevOps in people's titles should be useful for letting other folks know that this person is the go between. If they have questions or want to learn more about one side or the other, this person should be a great first step.",-1,0.0

When the DevOps Engineer chats with the Data Scientist.","Promotions can be grouped into two categories: progressive and successive.

Filling a pair of boots in a position above you? That's successive, and employers will absolutely hesitate to promote you away from where you deliver the most for the company.

But progressive promotions are always on the cards if you're good enough. When you're pushing a project and problem solving off your own back enough of the time instead of awaiting instructions, management time allocated to you will taper off.

Meanwhile the more work you take on, the closer you get to being able to demand an assistant to work with you and free up some of your time so you can spend more time delivering results in areas only you can deliver.

If you manage your assistant properly after choosing the new hire well, then you will de facto be in a position of more senior responsibility than you were before. This is a more difficult but more organic form of promotion, and can cascade into having an entire team working for you if you demonstrate the need followed by strong results.

Possession Wars Might Be Stifling Culture
While culture is a principal part of DevOps, it works out in a good way past Ninjas, Rockstars, and hoodies. At its center, DevOps culture is tied in with encouraging cooperation and results-driven exertion. Nonetheless, until tasks can sort out some way to all the more likely encourage culture inside its day by day exercises, this part of DevOps won't thrive. Foundation is as yet in activities' full control, however the way of life needs to length across advancement storehouses and embrace shared information, shared devices and shared methodologies. Without a sound DevOps culture, getting the legitimate cycles set up and apparatuses carried out will be substantially more testing.
The ""Device/App for That"" Generation
The pressing factor from business clients who accept everything can be settled with ""a basic application"" has become absolutely ruinous. Business clients are determined in their insight about incredible apparatuses, and gratitude to the development of open source or SaaS-based contributions, clients can frequently begin utilizing a free preliminary of the instrument in a flash – removing functional oversight. Far better, most clients accept each device ought to/has an application. Be that as it may, regardless of whether there is an application, it should be appropriately attached to all the other things to be valuable.
Activities should uphold the instrument/application advancement to keep up with mindfulness, administration and control. Dealing with the reception, combination and evaluation of a perpetual stock of devices and applications is very difficult so utilizing the common administrations idea to adjust instrument appointment and the board should be done right off the bat.",-1,0.0

Well, all labor workers kinda are. It's whole point of being employed, really.

Hence, so far I agreed.

But afterwards some things don't quite add up.

>Do you want 44% Tax? Welcome to Germany..

It's probably 42% in your case, isn't it? Except if you earn above 277'826 Euro but it sounds pretty much like you aren't. Also the costs of living usually aren't as high like at places in the US where you actually get jobs in IT. And apart from health insurance, you also getting a bunch of other social insurances.

For instance if you're getting laid off (which is harder to do in Germany than in the US — but that's a different topic) you also have an unemployment insurance included. Then you are still getting 60% (or 67% if you have kids) of your last salary paid by the goverment. And there are also Pflegeversicherung or Unfallversicherung that can help you if **** is on fire.

Furthermore there are also a bunch of other implicit perks like not having to fear that your kids die due to a school shooter, or not even having regular shootings in your place at all, or not having chlorinated chicken meat, or not having [flammable drinking water](https://www.propublica.org/article/scientific-study-links-flammable-drinking-water-to-fracking).

>MRI waitlist 3-4 months

hmm… that might rather be _something regional_ or not? But even then it sounds weird because I assume that you're living in Berlin ([since you had an interview at N26](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1b3znny/comment/ksvp4s3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) and [it looks like it's possible to get MRI appointments relatively quick in Berlin](https://www.doctolib.de/mrt-magnetresonanztomographie/berlin). Sure, some places are 'popular' and you will have to wait — but others just aren't.

And if your scroll a bit then you see some places in Berlin with free appointments next day. You can just take the S-Bahn to another one and you should be fine. No?

Or is the 4-month-place somehow special and does MRI differently than the others?

>Work life balance? **** work life balance when you keeping up with every new tech just to stay relevant on the market

hmm… this might rather be something that's _strongly dependent from your employer_. Because I usually had the chance to grow at my work place.

DevOps is not a department or a role. It has no defined boundaries as such. If they're having trouble finding someone that fits in that box, it's because they don't understand that they made the box up.

DevOps means developers owning their services in production and operators figuring out how to help them get there. There are roles that are better defined that take part in making that happen. SRE, Infrastructure Engineer, Automation Engineer, DevEx, and Platform Engineer all have specific connotations about what they're specifically good at because these are actual roles that people understand the general bounds of.

Edit: you've mentioned elsewhere in the comments that it's a role for practical purposes. The ""practical purposes"" concession is the issue in itself.

If a company was constituted of a single developer, they would be practicing DevOps.

Now let's say that the developer is having a hard time understanding why a bug is biting them in the **** over and over. Time to hire someone to come help.

What skills should this person have? Most of the big roles are overkill at that scale. We know see that bugs making it out into production is alleviated by pushing the problem to the left. This means better testing and better pipelines. An automation or release engineer may be appropriate.

The issue is that being able to pick the appropriate role requires knowledge of what the problem actually is. This is why the ""practical"" component is thinly veiled incompetence on the hiring manager's part.",0,0.9726521203856106

They don't know how to interview some one or they don't know what to ask.  So they start with the ""dev"" and give you a Leetcode interview.  And assuming you pass that, they ask you a bunch of trivia.  Neither of which is helpful in finding some one with talent.  At least this has been my experience interviewing a little bit over the last year.

I've been a sysadmin and developer for 25 years, so I've got a lot of experience automating things.  I can security configure an AWS environment with Terraform, monitor it with Prometheus, and configure a CI/CD pipeline to test & deploy your code using containers.  And it's all source controlled so we know who did what, when.  I can save you a ton on your cloud spend, build tools to be cloud agnostic, plus be your team lead and manager.  I'm friendly, outgoing, and enjoy explaining things to people.  And I've been using some form of \*nix since the days of SunOS in the early 90s.

None of that seems to matter these days.  If you can't write a recursive solution to backtrack over a string, then you obviously have nothing to offer.  If you've only ever used Elastic/Logstash you're not a good fit because we need some one with Splunk experience.  And if you've never configured BGP on a core router, then your networking skills aren't sharp enough.

I've interviewed a lot of people and I can figure out in about 20 minutes if some one is a good fit just by talking to them.  I ask them about their experience, give them a hypothetical scenario to solve, and maybe their opinions based on their history.  For example, if latency is spiking for certain requests to our application hosted in the cloud, how would you diagnose it?  Or how would you lock down a Linux host that's on the raw Internet?  If they've used Puppet and Ansible, why do they prefer one over the other?

No need to grind leetcode or spend weeks ""studying"".  If you're talented, your answers to these kinds of questions will make it obvious.",-1,0.0

It's a nondischargeable, high interest loan, and the unit you're paying/taking out debt of is time.  Business folks think of debt as a universally good thing, because they ideally pay off that debt with the profits from what they did with the loan.  But when you take a loan in time, you're not going to magically get more time later on to pay that off with - at some point you'll just have to spend the time paying it off. 

Once you get that, finding the numbers for the cost of that tech debt is pretty easy - you're looking for the interest payments on the debt.  It'll come in several forms - oncall load (from buggy/poorly tested features), extra design/development time (from overly complex or poorly designed systems that you're modifying), and worst case, customer pain/loss (from really bad bugs or performance).

You're never going to be able to say ""I will save you x"" though - instead you present it as ""if we had done this, we would have saved x/because we didn't do this, we had to pay x"".  Best way to do this is to tag outages/incidents, oncall tickets, and the difference between estimated time to deliver and actual time to deliver with the high level tech debt that caused or allowed them to happen.

When you go to tech leadership with ""we're spending 50% of our development time dealing with consequences of technical debt"", that will likely kick them in the **** - devs are ideally the most expensive part of a tech company, and wasting half of that cost on interest payments for a loan you're making no progress on is almost always going to be a major concern.",8,0.7616643489563316

If your other teams are doing their own silo'd things, then your company is operating more as like a fiefdom then an actual organization that works together. You can think of the teams that provide the platform as a platform team, and if other app teams that rely on the platform team aren't getting what they need from the platform team then they'll do their own thing (like go to Heroku, or just practice terrible security in their shadow IT cloud projects on AWS or wherever else). 

Advocating benefits of having a strong DevOps or platform team/capability within your company is one way of hopefully shifting the culture. This can be a series of workshops or lunch and learns to showcase the benefits. You can also try to build allies within your organization, so these are friendlies who understand the benefits and you find ways to advocate amongst them and use them to help bridge the gaps between the platform team and other departments. You can also try to leverage external benchmarks, like DORA (check out the DORA matrix, more at dora.dev) for example - and use these as guidelines to compare your companies practice against.

Unfortunately shifting organizational culture is more like a marathon and not a sprint and requires a lot of patience. Stay persistent and keep advocating for change.",21,1.0

Devops generally always suffers a bit in that since its not an actual feature being delivered, there's always a question over when a given devops solution is 'done'.

The rough route is:

* Try to implement a component (CI, CD, Secrets Handling, Integrations with other services, metrics, aggregation, recovery options etc etc etc take your pick)
* Get it to about 90% done
* 'Right it working fine now and we have a list of features to deliver, we'll gold plate it later' - time called, system has to go into use while incomplete and/or missing features
* Missing parts causes issue
* 'Oh ffs these systems are ****, so unreliable, we spent the time before and it's not been worth it, lets just slag it off/go for something else/just use the piece of **** team ABC has been using (and complaining about)' etc etc etc
* Return to initial bullet

I've seen this happen So. Many. Times over my career and its maddening. Any other form of engineering, delivering a partial solution would be understood to be providing partial functionality, but DevOps feels like its permanently cursed with never being able to properly finish stuff, even to MVP.

I think modern PHP is awesome compared to version 5.7. Don’t discount the work you do there.

Most of the Linux things you’ll deal with are now within docker containers rather than virtual machines, which make it easy to mess up, repeat, find how other people have done things and more. We just built our a docker image pipeline that adds nginx and some custom scripts for Datadog and other tools to a few different flavors of docker node and docker php and traditional sysadmin things were still needed, but still not highly in depth. 

There’s a need to understand nginx basics, but you don’t need to manage 30 nginx configs on a single server anymore. It’s much easier to manage 30 docker containers each with their own nginx. 

Most things related to pure Linux are getting abstracted and that knowledge is transferring to terraform and AWS or other cloud providers instead. Setting up ECS with Fargate and codedeploy is much easier and much more reliable than running Linux commands by hand and significantly more repeatable.

So your problem is that I use terms in my explanation? That's a weak counterpoint.

I've worked at multiple massive orgs (thousands of staff) with formal Change Management that had not transitioned to Agile Methodology/DevOps Ecosystems, and I have seen those that have. Change management has no value in these transitions. Go look up the MTTR difference before and after. This isn't the only thing that makes change management obsolete in such a transition, but it is the biggest aspect.

Now, since it sounds like you're not really interested in discussing this further, I'm going to go help others who are actually interested in having a conversation.

DevOps are hard to find- since the industry is very young and growing in an exponential rate, the available, experienced manpower is not sufficient to fill all the open positions. Unlike traditional developers, DevOps skills are obtained through years of hands-on work and therefore “fresh” graduates (of software or coding schools) are not the solution.
2. DevOps are expensive- DevOps make on average an annual salary of 144,00 US$, which is one of the highest salaries in the software industry.

The biggest issue I've seen with this is that putting documentation into the repo means the people who need it most are least likely to find it. If you need to know how a given service does XYZ and how it interacts with service ABC, you need to know where it is in the repo. 

That's before you get into architectural issues, where you either have to fragment your documentation or add stuff that ins't related to the app in the readme.

Implementing new schools of thought has always been a struggle, even if it is about replacing older methods with newer ones. Here are some of the challenges that people often face during DevOps implementation.
1. Lack of a Standard Definition for DevOps
Most people are still not aware of the actual meaning of DevOps, let alone the motto behind it, or for that matter, the benefits of using it.
In addition, some tend to believe in the notion that DevOps overrules other existing methodologies like Scrum and Kanban that are practiced in most industries. This is not so.
The fact is that DevOps helps to improve the execution of these existing methodologies. Hence, lack of proper understanding can often make the implementation of new methodologies risky. It gives rise to new problems that could affect the implementation of a stable process throughout the organization.
2. Dearth of Vision
Without a proper definition of the problem or solution, it is very difficult to have a vision. Thus, when analysts get used to a process, they start following a certain path specific to managing things. Despite that, at some point in time, they too are stuck in a circle.
It becomes very difficult to break this ambiguous circle, be more receptive to current scenarios, and discover newer methods for betterment – all at the same time!
Without a proper plan, it is impossible to achieve a stable and profitable output. Lack of vision makes it challenging for project owners to create a clear-cut plan when it comes to deciding an estimate, milestones, and deliverables, to name a few.
Analysts often find it risky because there are only a handful of people who have expertise in this domain, compared to the number of tools that are available in the market. This could often give rise to confusion when it comes to proper implementation, ultimately leading to an exponential increase in the risk factor.
3. Shortage of Tool Knowledge
DevOps has introduced the principles of continuous deployment, continuous testing, and collaborative reporting. However, since most people prefer to continue work with legacy tools, getting accustomed to the functionalities of the latest tools is often a difficult job, especially when it comes to getting a grip on the changes made to the architecture based on cloud and on-premises during the process.
A shortage of tool knowledge often leads organizations into making faulty choices of tools that would best align with their technical vision.
4. Choice of Tools
There are plenty of tools available on the market. However, it becomes difficult to choose a tool when we lack the proper knowledge about the technology behind it. All these make the idea of implementation of a DevOps scenario extremely difficult.
5. Lack of Tool Integration
Continuous integration is one of the pillars of DevOps methodology. In order to make Build, Deploy, and Test work together in a continuous form, we need the tools to be properly integrated.
However, the crux of the matter is how to get the tools integrated. That is because integrating tools belonging to various domains on one common platform is a big challenge.
6. Cultural Challenges
The biggest challenge here is the disposal of legacy methods and the adaptation of new ones. Of course, one can always prefer to continue following the conventional methodologies as long as the outcome is good at the end of the day.
On the contrary, if the outcome is poor, or for that matter, if you realize that your job demands many manual interventions, then it would be best to realize that this could hamper the overall rate of productivity and lead to an adverse effect on the long run.
7. Isolated Teams
Development and Operations have their own challenges. While developers are constantly writing pieces of code in order to build a system, testers perform a thorough analysis to ensure product stability before the final delivery to the customer.
You can see there lies a big gap between teams. Both Dev and Ops work in silos, leading to a lack of transparency and poor teamwork.
8. Risk Analysis
We know how difficult it is to disrupt age-old methodologies and replace them with new ones. When it comes to risk analysis, business analysts design their dashboards by scaling hundreds of reports. This is done based on certain calculations. Most of the time, it is easy to start but tough to scale. That is, after putting things into action, workers often face the trouble of trying to keep the pace steady. Thus, adopting a new methodology involves risks to a great extent.
9. Scarcity of SMEs
DevOps is a methodology that is fresh in the market. Hence, it is difficult to find members who have adequate expertise in this field. Due to this fact, most of the challenges are intimidating for companies following a streamlined set of guidelines.
In addition, the absence of a strong DevOps development team at the center or lack of pre-defined KPIs can often make conditions miserable for employees.",0,1.0

I just realised that because I started my response with `43.  ` Reddit converted my answer to a one-bullet list so it looked like I didn't answer your question!

I can see where you're coming from on that one.  I had a lengthy discussion with my old boss about this a couple months ago.  They still build everything locally bare-metal and then deploy to bare-metal self-hosted servers.  They're a Python shop, so they're bound by the Python version of the CentOS target environment and the Ops people have rules about what packages they'll tolerate on their machines... it's a Pain In The ****, and yet the dude just looked at me like *I* was the crazy one pitching something as new-fangled as Docker.

I put off using it for years for similar reasons as you mentioned.  I was a Gentoo guy, so I could happily build a project locally with 3 versions of Python and even multiple versions of PostgreSQL to better reflect production.  The idea of building a releaseable, tested image felt like overkill, but once I adopted that pattern, everything that came before feels like working with stone tools :-)",11,1.0

Design a piece of equipment, tell people how to make it, test it, and then help market it. That's a pretty normal workflow for a design engineer in most mid-size manufacturing companies. At one point, all they did was design it. But something went wrong with making it, and the engineers knew the best way to fix the problem as they have the most experience.

I got blamed for not taking on knowledge quickly enough while being paid near entry-level salary. They laid me off after 6 months and I landed a job soon after with a significant pay raise and title, which sounds like humblebragging -- or straight up lying on the internet -- but I'll be honest, I was so **** with how the previous job was handled I felt the need to overcompensate and bust my ****. That with a little (lot) of luck and here we are.

The point is, companies and teams don't know what to do with devops and sre a lot of the time. They see a title and they all think different things. The worst types of jobs are the ones where devops / sre falls on one person, who gets no flowers when things (everything's fine, what do you even do?) are working and plenty of blame when things aren't working (things aren't working, what do you even do?)

This combined with the hardest part of devops / sre: integrating technologies that are new / esoteric and not a lot of documentation for it, so you have to create your own tools, but learning those technologies don't have a ton of carryover to the next company who has no use case for it.",-1,0.0

Let's take a moment to feel the pain of their devops team","It's a bit of too late now, but back then ITIL was en vogue... except of course management had to put their own spin on it. In other words cargo cult and micromanage (lest a director or VP cede control of anything under their domain). The end result defeating any benefits ITIL _might_ have provided. I have no doubt any other framework would have met a similar end.

Fundamentally, the problem was most of IT management was incredibly dysfunctional. The only things that would get funding (and thus done) were largely useless window dressing a particular business unit wanted (despite providing questionable business benefit). Any sort of investment in infrastructure that could improve stability were of course never done (since no business unit would even sign off on it, even if it didn't come out of their pocket -- after all it might mean that then they didn't get _their_ shiny done now now now).

This structure was so ossified, their solution to fix this wasn't to get rid of the directors and VP that cemented things into place.. the answer of course was offshoring! Offshore everything not nailed down, with their 'airtight' contracts with IBM and EDS. All their problems will be solved! (narrator: they weren't solved).

My group (and a few others) managed to avoid the offshoring, but we still had to deal with the dysfunction, which is why I finally quit (as well as having a cheapskate director who was willing to tank a $60 million dollar project and try to pass the blame one to me and a few others -- all because he was scared about less than $10k in his own travel budget). Since then, the company (while a F500, was either second to last or last in their industry), has merged with the other bottom contender in a (likely) vain attempt to challenge the two leaders, though a lot of the same terrible middle management is still there.",8,1.0

Or your backend is air gapped and your CAs cant easily talk to the backend so you have to design a semi-automatic solution for 200 certs to get them past the air gap, but that opens security holes so it needs to go into security review.... and you just rolled all your ops guys into DevOps so no one is really tracking anything and it gets lost until you have a giant incident then it's a massive priority for 3 weeks.

Cultural Resistance: DevOps encourages collaboration, breaking down silos between development and operations teams. However, teams accustomed to traditional structures may resist changes in workflows and responsibilities. Encouraging a culture of openness, continuous learning, and shared responsibility becomes paramount to overcoming this challenge. 🔄👫
Toolchain Complexity: Another challenge lies in managing the diverse toolchain associated with DevOps—from continuous integration tools to deployment automation. Integrating these tools seamlessly can be complex and requires expertise to ensure a streamlined workflow. 🧰🤯
Skillset Evolution: DevOps demands a shift in skillsets. Team members need to adapt to new tools, automation, and collaboration methods. Providing training and fostering a learning culture helps mitigate this challenge. 📚👨‍💻
Successfully navigating these challenges positions organizations to fully reap the rewards of DevOps, fostering agility, efficiency, and accelerated delivery. 🌈🏆

Pretty sure we've all run into syntax issues, and sometimes your IDE doesn't throws false positives etc. This post really made me want to go look into local parsers, maybe as a pre-commit hook.


Local pipeline testing is sus imo, and I haven't used a system that had that function (granted, I've only used pipelines and GitHub actions). I can build out flows no problem, but the tricky part is when I decide to use built in variables that AzDO pipelines support (just like with any other pipeline system, they have built in variables) -- if I'm testing locally, how does my local system know what values to assign these variables? Along with this, your local environment does not equal the environment where the hosted/self-hosted agent runs (that ""well it works on my computer, it must be yours"" situation).


As far as AzDO goes, I think it's a great jack of all trades, master of none. The main benefit I've worked with, is the integration with Azure and other Microsoft services. I can create a service connection to Azure with a service principal and authenticate my pipelines to run in Azure pretty easily.

**Knowledge** is knowing everything about their existing stack and existing tech problems.


**Skill** is having the ability to understand/learn a system or new technology quickly, solve complex problems, reduce toil, and apply best complex systems design practices. 


Having a base level of knowledge is fine in the short term, but the skills are required long term. When I interview people I focus mostly on skills. 


Additionally, I think many startups think more highly of themselves than they deserve.  A Devops job at a startup is **BRUTAL** but a beautiful learning environment.  


Having worked at several startups, and being a M&A SRE at a big company I can tell you, At a startup you have:   


* Devs that love having many flavor of the week/new hotness technologies complicating the stack

* A fragile system that typically can have a lot of outages

* Founders who want to skimp on costs affecting architecture, staffing resources, and monitoring/diagnosing tools.

* Founders who won't stop overriding things or sticking their hands in the **** unnecessarily


* People pitching things on PowerPoints that may not be actually possible


* Move fast and break things attitude where teams don't really own their own breakages, and there's a lack of documentation and they don't hold the pagers for the site being down


* A lack of testing environment so you get a lot of ""well it worked on my laptop"" 


* Scaling issues if the company grows quickly either resulting in load breakages or developers using the original prototype monoliths as opposed to micro services and have difficulty applying large system design principles like globally unique IDs, back off code, or foreign key constraints. 


* **** pay compared to what you could get at a big company, and usually not great equity / equity doesn't pay off because they're not one of the first engineers or seen as vital because they're not building sexy features. 


Startup founders need to recognize the job they're asking people to do, and be open to people less ""senior"" than they think they deserve.


**That being said** I heard that Google's SRE acceptance rate is 2% so it may be more indication of the space as a whole, I don't know how true that is because my interview there was the easiest and most enjoyable interviewing experience I've ever had, but I did study for a month or more before my onsite, had been in the industry for awhile, and had the benefit of their SRE book being available at that time.",0,1.0

As a side note, one of my favorite assignments was when one class just handed us links to the HTTP/1.1 specification and a guide to working with sockets in C, then told each of us to make a minimal HTTP server and client.

If you don't have any managerial authority, you're not going to get any cooperation.  Most of the time when chaos rules, people benefit from the chaos.  That's why it's tolerated.  The chaos is a system.  A hierarchy.  A pecking order.  But if you have firing authority, read sun tzu's the art of war.  Then read the practice of system administration and networking, and the practice of cloud administration.  Of course, also read the phoenix project.  You'll be able to effectively legitimize your authority and clean up shop to consolidate your authority.

Don't fool yourself into thinking that a chaotic system isn't ordered.  Not having git or any project management removes accountability.  Those who benefit -- there's typically only one or two, and they typically are bullies -- will see you as a threat.  Make your actions that of a dictator and you'll get your order that you need.

For the larger majority, you won't have such problems.  People typically like fair environments where no one has an unfair advantage.

However, they face several challenges that can make achieving this goal tricky. Here are some of the most common hurdles DevOps teams encounter:
1. Resistance to Cultural Change
One of the biggest challenges is fostering collaboration between development and operations teams, especially in organizations with deeply rooted silos. Adopting a DevOps mindset requires breaking old habits, redefining roles, and encouraging cross-functional collaboration, which everyone doesn’t always welcome.
Solution: Promote open communication, provide proper training, and secure buy-in from leadership to create a culture of shared responsibility.
2. Tool Overload and Integration Issues
With countless tools available for CI/CD, monitoring, configuration management, and more, teams often face ""tool sprawl."" Choosing the right tools and ensuring seamless integration can be overwhelming.
Solution: Standardize tools across teams, evaluate needs carefully before adopting new technologies, and automate tool integration wherever possible.
3. Lack of Expertise or Skills Gap
DevOps requires a blend of skills in development, operations, automation, and cloud technologies. Finding professionals who are proficient in all these areas can be difficult, leaving teams with skill gaps.
Solution: Invest in upskilling existing team members through training programs, certifications, and hands-on workshops.
4. Security and Compliance Challenges
Integrating security into the DevOps pipeline (DevSecOps) can be complex. Teams need to balance speed with security while also adhering to regulatory requirements.
Solution: Shift security left by incorporating automated security testing early in the CI/CD pipeline and adopting tools that enforce compliance rules.
5. Scaling DevOps Across Teams
What works for a single team may not scale effectively across the organization. Different teams might have varying workflows, tools, and processes, making it difficult to standardize practices.
Solution: Establish a central DevOps governance model, adopt reusable pipelines, and use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to create consistent environments.
6. Inefficient Monitoring and Feedback Loops
It’s challenging to detect and resolve issues early without proper monitoring, which can lead to longer downtimes and poor user experiences. Similarly, inadequate feedback loops delay continuous improvement.
Solution: Use advanced monitoring tools to gain real-time insights into performance and set up automated feedback loops for quicker resolution and iteration.
7. Managing Legacy Systems
Integrating modern DevOps practices with legacy systems can be a major roadblock, especially when outdated architectures don’t support automation or cloud deployment.
Solution: Gradually modernize legacy systems by adopting containerization, microservices, and APIs where feasible.
8. Unrealistic Expectations for Speed
Organizations often view DevOps as a quick fix for faster delivery, leading to pressure on teams to deliver without a solid foundation in place.
Solution: Set realistic goals, prioritize building a strong DevOps culture, and focus on incremental improvements rather than immediate results.
By addressing these challenges proactively, organizations can build robust and efficient DevOps teams capable of driving faster, more reliable software delivery. Have you encountered any of these challenges in your DevOps journey? Share your experience in the comments!",0,1.0

addressing these challenges proactively organizations achieve greater agility improved collaboration enhanced operational efficiency,2025,What are the common challenges when scaling DevOps in large organizations?,"Scaling DevOps in large organizations presents unique challenges due to the complexity of processes, tools, and cultural shifts required. While DevOps aims to improve collaboration, automation, and efficiency, achieving these goals at scale can be challenging. Below are some of the most common challenges organizations face:
1. Cultural Resistance and Organizational Silos
Challenge: Resistance to change from traditional teams accustomed to siloed operations (e.g., separate development, operations, and security teams).Difficulties in fostering collaboration between departments with different goals and priorities.
Solution: Promote a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility through leadership support, training, and incentives. Encourage cross-functional teams and DevOps champions to drive cultural change.
2. Standardization Across Diverse Teams and Technologies
Challenge: Different teams often use a variety of tools, workflows, and processes, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. Lack of a unified approach to version control, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and security.
Solution: Establish organization-wide DevOps guidelines, frameworks, and best practices. Implement common tools and platforms that can be customized for individual team needs.
3. Complexity in Toolchain Integration
Challenge:Large enterprises use multiple tools across different teams, which may not always integrate seamlessly.Managing compatibility issues and ensuring consistent data flow across the DevOps pipeline can become overwhelming.
Solution:Invest in toolchain orchestration solutions that provide seamless integrations (e.g., GitLab, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Terraform).Regularly review and consolidate toolsets to avoid redundancy and simplify operations.
4. Security and Compliance at Scale
Challenge:Maintaining security standards and regulatory compliance across multiple teams, environments, and regions can be difficult.DevOps often prioritizes speed, which can sometimes compromise security practices.
Solution:Adopt DevSecOps, integrating security practices into CI/CD pipelines from the start.Use automated security scanning, policy enforcement, and access controls across all environments.
5. Maintaining Consistency Across Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Environments
Challenge:Enterprises often operate across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and on-premises environments, leading to deployment inconsistencies.Ensuring seamless performance, security, and cost optimization across different environments.
Solution:Utilize infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to maintain consistency.Adopt cloud-agnostic tools and practices to facilitate multi-cloud orchestration.
6. Scaling CI/CD Pipelines Efficiently
Challenge:As teams grow, the complexity of continuous integration and deployment increases, leading to bottlenecks, longer feedback loops, and inefficiencies.Parallel builds and deployments may introduce resource constraints.
Solution:Implement scalable CI/CD pipelines with parallel testing and deployments using tools like Kubernetes, Jenkins, and GitOps.Optimize pipeline performance by breaking it down into microservices-based workflows.
7. Managing Legacy Systems and Technical Debt
Challenge:Older systems and applications often do not align with modern DevOps practices, creating roadblocks in automation and deployment.Technical debt accumulates over time, making it difficult to modernize infrastructure and processes.
Solution:Gradual refactoring and modernization of legacy systems through containerization or microservices adoption.Incremental migration to cloud-native solutions while maintaining legacy system stability.
8. Measuring and Demonstrating ROI
Challenge:Proving the value of DevOps transformation to stakeholders can be challenging, especially when ROI isn't immediately visible.Difficulty in setting clear KPIs to measure performance improvements and business impact.
Solution:Define key DevOps metrics such as deployment frequency, lead time for changes, mean time to recovery (MTTR), and failure rates.Use data-driven reports to showcase progress and justify continued investment.
9. Talent Shortages and Skill Gaps
Challenge:Scaling DevOps requires specialized skill sets, and finding skilled DevOps engineers and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) can be difficult.Training existing teams to adopt new tools and processes takes time and effort.
Solution:Invest in continuous training and certification programs for employees.Hire experienced DevOps professionals and mentor internal talent to build a skilled workforce.
10. Automation Complexity and Governance
Challenge:Automating complex workflows across diverse teams and environments without introducing risks or inefficiencies.Balancing automation with governance, ensuring that compliance and policies are followed.
Solution:Implement robust governance frameworks with automated policy enforcement.Leverage AI-driven automation tools to ensure self-healing and intelligent decision-making in the DevOps pipeline.
11. Collaboration and Communication Challenges
Challenge:Lack of real-time collaboration and transparency between distributed teams working across different time zones.Inconsistent documentation and unclear ownership of responsibilities.
Solution:Utilize collaboration tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and project management platforms to improve communication.Promote a ""single source of truth"" by maintaining proper documentation in platforms like Confluence or Notion.
12. Managing Cloud Costs and Resource Utilization
Challenge:As cloud adoption scales, uncontrolled resource usage can lead to unexpected cost overruns.Identifying underutilized resources and optimizing them can be challenging.
Solution:Implement cloud cost management tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management) to track and optimize cloud expenses.Set up automated policies to shut down unused resources and rightsizing instances.
Scaling DevOps in large organizations requires a strategic approach that balances technology, culture, and governance. By addressing these challenges proactively, organizations can achieve greater agility, improved collaboration, and enhanced operational efficiency.",0,1.0

> Writing java is no more automated job than writing assembler.

The whole point of Java is that it automates just about everything for you: memory management, text and graphics display, file access, communicating over a network.  The JVM is *automated* in that it takes care of all of the **** work for you, and you just focus on business logic.  For example, the JVM *automatically* garbage collects.  AUTOMATICALLY.  You dullard.

Being a good developer means automating your own work when you find yourself repeating anything.  That's why compilers were written.  If you find yourself typing in the same console commands over and over again for a certain task, you write a shell script for it.  That's what I mean by our jobs being AUTOMATED - you can write code to AUTOMATE processes for you, and whatever you're doing, you're taking advantage of AUTOMATION that others have set up for you.  Like in Eclipse, you can refactor code, renaming a class method and all of its references throughout your project...

A lot of people love to gatekeep here because the skill ceiling is so high.  If your company decided to offer you a job after your internship, that means they are probably willing to invest in your success and train you to fit their specific niche! 
DevOps means a lot of things to a lot of people, so it could be that your company has more beginner-friendly tasks than others, or you’re just really what they were looking for! 

In general though, DevOps takes a lot of knowledge, because you’re working on systems that touch so many different pieces of the business.  That’s why it’s the definition of “jack of all trades,” and also why interviews can take some interesting turns (like above) when people are trying to say they have all that generalized knowledge, but really don’t. 

Of course, if you want to really dive into DevOps as a career choice, most people here would strongly suggest using the roadmap, as it’s pretty robust, but I’d definitely focus on whatever your company uses first and foremost! 
Gain knowledge in that, then you can slowly start adding other pieces in that you might not have experience with yet (like terraform, cloud, etc), but that people in the subreddit mention often!

Since you said you're now in charge of this mess, leaving the company seems to be out of the question, which is what my first suggestion would have been had you not been in charge.

To keep it simple, your problem isn't technological; it's social. If people aren't using a VCS in 2015, there's something fundamentally wrong with your company's knowledge of technology and how they think, operate and approach technological challenges, and installing the right software isn't going to fix it. They're either resilient to changing trends or can't/won't keep up with progress.

Without further information, I'd guess you're dealing with people who are still living in the past and have not caught up with the latest developments. And by the past, I mean 1980's. Adults are hard to change, and if your job is to convince people to fast-forward 30 years into the future, you're wasting your time.

The mess may seem like a mess to you, but to them, it's the norm, and they probably haven't seen what you've seen and know what you know. In fact, they probably think they're the best in the world at what they do. 

If you want to try to get them to change their minds, set up a series of presentations and show them what you plan to achieve. Show them what practices you want to implement and compare it to what they're currently doing. Show them how 99% of the rest of the industry operates and why it works. See how receptive they are to these ideas. Run a poll to gather what people think and how willing they are to go through with your changes.

Seriously though, the lack of git is a big deal. What kind of organization doesn't use a vcs? How the **** do you code? Do you just send code in an email?

This statement is often abused for a lot of things unfortunately.

There are LOTS of things that can break in code. The very core algorithms and software structure that is totally under the control of devs are much more sensitive to break things. One small but nasty bug can bring the entire application down. The team's experience, and a healthy amount of automated tests and QA seek to minimize these risks.

But then ops come in and think that by denying a request to update JSF for a Java EE shop, they can somehow guarantee a better uptime of the application? Since upgrade is risk, and all developers are morons that don't understand the risks of upgrades?

And then of course comes the treat; ""We don't want to upgrade your **** JSF lib, but if we do and something breaks at that magical 4 AM you have to be woken up and fix it!""

But how is this different from any other code change that's made to the application? You know, these code changes that happen daily? If they break something and QA doesn't catch it, will ops be able to fix anything then?

Of course not! Ops has no idea about why a particular service wasn't injected into a particular bean that has request scope but should have had view scope. Such things have to be fixed by dev anyway.

So the 4 am threat is pretty useless. If dev says a new version of JSF is needed, then a new version of JSF is needed. Period. In the first place the task to (ultimately) decide over the version of JSF should not have been given to ops in the first place, but if it unfortunately has been they should not make treats about it.

Again, this would be akin to making treats about deploying a new version of the application that dev has developed and that has been tested.

This is what DevOps should be (maybe you could also consider us SREs but that's a separate issue).

Developers don't have experience (or honestly, desire) to build high-quality production infrastructure, meaning you need an ops team. The whole point of dev-ops is for the ops team to be more communicative with the dev team so ops isn't a black box where requests go (the exact thing the author is complaining about doing at their job, this isn't DevOps).

Transition normally means highly increased operational load and quite possibly redundant old + new infrastructure. Again, budget. This time it means not only payroll directly, but also hardware.

Good automation is not just cobbling together ""shitty YAMLs"" but designing a robust system using pipelines and smart infrastructure.

Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly, reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours. The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases.

In addition to that, I would recommend that you be prepared to do a lot more Linux stuff, but DevOps is not exclusive to Linux. But there is way more market share for LInux than Windows. If you want to stay married to Windows then so be it, but if you are alright switching to Linux you will make more money and have better career opportunities. 100% your call.

As I mention in the linked post I wrote, I would say reading The Phoenix Project will give you a lot of insight and example as to how it could look. It is not the only way to do things, but it can help guide you conceptually.

In addition to that, I would recommend building a homelab so you can build your own DevOps environment in a safe area where failure has no cost. If you already have a homelab, then use it for building your own DevOps stuff.

As I mention in the post, the two aspects are Software Development and Infrastructure Management. Decide which (or both?) you want to learn, and use that to help guide building/replicating that in your homelab.

As for tech that you can use, I'm going to point you to (but this is NOT an exhaustive/exclusive list):

1. Rancher, to help you manage kubernetes/k8s nodes/clusters.
2. Gitlab, so you can self-host your own repositories for IaC (Infrastructure as Code) yaml/other content, and/or for software development code if you so desire.
3. Proxmox VE to run VMs on, and k8s nodes within those VMs, gitlab in a VM, stuff like that.
4. TrueNAS for a NAS system everything is going to be kept on.
5. VSCode or Codium for an IDE (think, feature-rich text editor) to help you with writing/editing code on your Gitlab repos.
6. Check out [this list](https://fleet.linuxserver.io) of docker images you can use for some example starting projects to use in your environment. There are plenty elsewhere too, but this can help give you many starting options.

* Candidate doesn't know anything and can't answer basic questions about technologies they supposedly worked on for 4 years
* Candidate pretends there are technical difficulties with their camera or screen sharing or internet

Bad situation I was in: I was on a team writing an API that would be used by all developers at studio.  The ""asset"" team was worried about us handling assets since they did practically nothing, so they wrote a really crappy API we had to go through.  Their crappy API was built on an Oracle database managed by the database team.  At one point I filed a ticket for a particular call being too slow.  They in turn filed a ticket for the database team.  From the database team's perspective the ticket said, ""100% CPU usage"" with very little info on what we were actually doing.  I quickly realized after a couple weeks that ticket would never be resolved.  It was a horrible topology and made everything slow.  The mantra there was everyone had to go through some other team and everything had to be approved by the owner.  

Good situation: At my current job every team almost acts like a service, but in a good way.  Devops in particular is an enabler.  They write tools for the cloud instances, but I set up my own instances.  They write tools for throwing up a redundant sql service with a DNS endpoint.  I use it.  I've been able to write huge swaths of tools without needing any kind of approval from devops.  They have just answered any questions I've had along the way.  Often when I had a concern they would point me to some existing tool (with documentation on the wiki) on how to overcome it.  My team owns the stack for everything we write unless we make other arrangements.  I've thrown up a web server and database on separate internal domains in a few minutes.

It's more about making an operations guy more developer than replacing the developer with a jack of all trades.  All the devops places I know of still have a dedicated development team.

DevOps is devoted to the development of operational tools that ease infrastructure concerns.  They're responsible for figuring out how to spinup 18 instances of your code.  You're still responsible for the code.

The DBA is still responsible for making sure indexes are properly used, query planning and SQL functions written, their sorts of jobs.  They might determine the parameters needed for the config files.  The DevOps person would have the config files puppetized so they can turn up 18 DB servers at a time, maybe all standalone, maybe clustered depending on needs.

The important thing to take away from DevOps is that a UNIX machine is not a unique snowflake.  You shouldn't be naming your boxes funny names because that attaches love to them.  Modern systems are made to be created and destroyed in minutes or even seconds.  The goal is to spin them up, run a single process, then recycle them if they're not needed anymore.  Of course this all means they should be virtual machines.

The reason ""dev"" is in the job title isn't because you're a developer, but because puppet and the like are complex tools that currently need a developer.

Kubernetes has pretty good tooling for it, but puppet is in my opinion a lot easier to set up from scratch. Kubernetes is great because of the beautifully simple api and the interplay you can have between resources that listen to each other. Kubernetes is great for high availability, self-healing and abstracting away storage and network. But you don't need that abstraction.

For example, you could manage database users and roles with a spreadsheet or whatever in git, then have ci/cd trigger on a merge, which starts a container that sets the state to what you defined, fails if it doesn't pass validation, comment the output in the pull request. That's basically what the operator pattern in kubernetes is.  

You can do pretty much anything in Linux like this. Installing stuff, uninstalling stuff, updating stuff, configuring stuff. Puppet Enterprise can do this very easily (so can any other automation tool), and you could just build it yourself if you wanted. https://www.puppet.com/docs/pe/2021.2/control_repo.html 

You can definitely manage traditional systems like that, just with actual pipelines increased of the indirect pipelines that effectively run when Flux reconciles your cluster.

Systemd can do the self-healing very easily. For autoscaling you can do it indirectly with vmware by overprovisioning - means you tell 10 VMs they each have 100gb RAM and 8 CPUs, but in reality they share maybe just 16 CPUs and 500gb RAM, not 80 CPUs and 1TB RAM.

It started out as a fairly well defined thing: basically meaning all four letters of LAMP.

I get a giggle out of snarky comments like ""I'm not calling you a full stack developer unless you know VHDL"", because they highlight that a lot of these new terms are actually borne of web development (used to be a separate category to software development until pretty much all new UIs became webapps).

""Full stack web developer"" makes perfect sense, in that you can set up a web site on a server, write HTML, CSS and Javascript.

""Full stack software developer"" is usually nonsense, because roles almost never need you to understand the machine all the way from the Translation Lookaside Buffer all the way up to Angular.js.",22,1.0

Yes I can. Because I've seen what correctly implemented looks like, in many orgs of many sizes. The largest involving over 5,000 physical systems running multiples more of logical systems on top of that.

Yes, it does look different from one company to the next, but that doesn't mean correct implementations happen every time. Even with non-DevOps implementations/transitions improper work happens plenty. Ever heard of SAP?

I also have had my own start-ups, and a career and connections that has allowed me to see way too many companies’ insides.  When you said this:

> We are getting dedicated infrastructure people, so that our developers focus on developing. Why? Because we are interested in becoming a business and not remaining a startup forever.

Yup, you know exactly what you are talking about.  Developers working on production infrastructure is dangerous.  I don’t care how smart they tell you they are, they don’t know as much as proper sys admins, and your system will likely end up a mess with no redundancy, scalability, back-ups, security, etc.  Plus the sheer number of man-hours, lack of focus, and context shifts keeps them away from product and customers.  Now, they will tell you they can do it, because shiny new things to play with, don’t believe them.  

What most people don’t know is you can get fully managed from good companies like Linode, Rackspace Cloud, Engine Yard, VM Farms, etc. for great prices instead of doing it themselves.  People think it is expensive, but once you consider they handle so much for you, it is really good business decision compared to high programmer man hours, or worse hiring, which with the fierce market for talent out there can take many months at least.

&#x200B;

DevOps != CI/CD

It works for smaller sized companies, but as the number of moving parts and the number of humans associated with it within the organization increases, so does the load on the DevOps team. Most of the time the DevOps team is spending on setting up IAM permissions, Audits, Compliance, Setting up a new project environment for the dev team, debugging a terraform module etc. This is from personal experience.

There is no time for actually trying to reduce toil, or make the overall infrastructure more efficient. How do we fix this? By having something that abstracts away all of these toils onto something else. 

How do we do that? Team spending too much time helping teams with IAM permissions? Build something that makes it better, build a system that lets developers get the access they need just by clicking few buttons and getting an approval from their managers/the SREs. Audits? No problem, the system we built already has it in a way where we don't need to manually go hunting for them.

Are you spending too much time setting up a new kubernetes cluster each time for different projects? Re-think it, spend some time and figure out what will work best for your team. Maybe a single cluster that has all the safeguards and some automation will work wonders, maybe build something that creates a cluster with safeguards, proper firewall rules, proper monitoring etc.

Does all of it sound like a dream? Maybe it does, but this is what's been working for me.

Yeah. ENGINEERING CUSTOMERS. They aren’t your team anymore. They are your business's second set of customers, but if these customers aren’t buying it, you end up with morale problems, engineers pining for “the old way,” a boatload of debt, and a bunch of wasted time and effort.",-1,0.0

I just went through a phase of job applications and interviews, and most jobs with the word ""devops"" in the name are straight up IT operations from the mid-2000s.

I was hired as a senior manager and promised to expand a global effort.  I was promised an overseas move at signing to get me closer to my spouse's family.

When the cards fell I'm now jobless a year later, why?

The team overseas refused to answer my emails, never invited me to meetings, never gave me credentials that consistently worked, never gave me documentation access, never gave me a bigger picture (which i was tasked with enhancing our platform's security through analysis of our infrastructure).

I was given random QA tasks that were on scrapped products.

They didn't want me looped in.

They wanted to meet a legal requirement for X number of US based employees.

The coworkers would speak their native tongue when troubleshooting IF and IF i was looped in very rarely during the first quarter.

My boss downplayed my experience, when i questioned a cybersecurity incident and what we'd done, they literally mopped the floor wiped the VMs and repeated their deployment keeping everything the same.

Nothing i mean NOTHING will get you to hate tech faster than a culture that doesn't want to be inclusive of new folks.

When the DevOps Engineer chats with the Data Scientist.","The problem is that the dependencies are both very specific and they often rely on external libraries.

For example pytorch relies on very specific cuda versions, which have somewhat specific driver versions, and the way you install pytorch is to give python's pip package installer a specific source URL for that specific cuda version, but (iirc) the actual pytorch version for all the different cuda versions are the exact same.

And that's the nice installation. Tensorflow is approximately 3x as fiddly to install, with very very specific dependencies, some that needs either a binary wheel or a full C compile stack with relevant libraries.

Oh, and a few now require rust compiler, because why wouldn't they.

At least docker is now doing pretty well on giving gpu access, so you can just put it all in a container and be done with it.

Edit: and that's the new and improved stuff. Back when tensorflow was the new hotness you had a tf version only working with one specific cuda version, cuda had no good support for multiple versions installed, TF being in such rapid change that minor and even bugfix versions could break code, TF dependencies being just as fragile, and some having somewhat specific versions of python they worked on.

And of course just about every project and tutorial you found was for a different TF version",3,0.5626213663395144

Ended up in a position managing a zoo of about 70 clusters of varying sizes all on colo hosts with a self-run k8s cluster for random bits where we were responsible for managing the Elasticsearch itself, as well as all the logging pipelines. So it ended up being great for me with my Linux admin/syseng background while knowing enough about networking, deep guts of Linux junk, and how to research/troubleshoot random stuff skills. And now we're migrating it all to the Cloud so I'm learning terraform/IaC, managed K8s, etc. Been great)

One of the things I found at the time was that a lot of ""DevOps"" type jobs were very heavy on the software development side, and I'm absolutely not a developer by any stretch. I can manage my way around some bash and python utility scripts to help out with some stuff but I'd be completely hopeless with, say, a frontend or full-stack development position where I was writing code all day. I came up through Infrastructure/SysEng type positions where I got very good at Linux admin and management a lot of the random other skills that come in handy for that like networking, DNS, routing, and all that.

However, over the years it seems like the posts here and other devopsy places have started shifting towards people complaining they're looking for engineers and can't find anybody who can do the infra side of things, which has been interesting to see. Especially since my company tells me I'm more or less at the top of my pay band there, and I'm only going to be getting minimal increases at this point. And I'm not making $260k a year.

That ended up a novel, yeesh. At any rate, I should look around.",-1,0.0

When we hire, we don't expect our juniors and mid-level hires to be ""experts"" across the stacks.

We look for:

\- Someone who is autodidactic, but also a team player and willing to learn from others.  
\- Someone who is competent with at least *some* of our stack.

The rest we fill in as they grow into the team.

IMHO, the big problem is the companies who expect ""experts"" at the junior level (or worse, try to get experts at the junior salary scales) and who don't have any seniors on the team to guide and mentor the direction of the team.

""Juniors"" should not be expected to have any deep knowledge. But they should understand the high level concepts, they should be familiar with the tools, and they should know how to learn and when to ask for help.

""Mid Level"" staff should begin to have a depth of knowledge in at last one, it not more, of the stacks

In all cases, adaptability and continuing education is a requirement for these jobs. I've met some excellent senior software engineers who can do magic with Java, but who would make terrible DevOps engineers because they never learned about DNS, networking, containers, etc. Similarly, I've met very competent sysadmins who don't know how to compile software, let alone build a container image.

I'd take a motivated Junior self-learner over either of those seniors any day, and that's what we had with our last intern, and what we currently have with our latest Junior hire. We really just have to help them to learn when to ask for help so that they aren't spinning their wheels on ""easy"" things that they aren't familiar with yet.",9,0.5442768702058491

IMO data scientists do not need to know this and it isn't really their job, they should be working with engineers to get their model deployed properly. It would help if they have some understanding of what is required as well as the challenges, but when it comes to ""how do customers actually use it"", they should be responsible for knowing how data gets in and how it's going to be made available to the backend or client but that's about it.*  
  
A machine learning engineer, on the other hand, should know a fair bit more about this process and if they can't do most of this themselves, at least be of a much greater help to the engineers who are actually figuring out how to get their model working and deployed in prod.   
  
It's like expecting a designer to do frontend. Some of them can, sure, but it's not expected of most and they don't need to know the details of how their designs get turned into a website or app UI.

And since time costs money, you convert time into money, too.

If something is taking devs hours to maintain every week, and a bit of exploration shows that a one time cost of $10k would help them prune and optimize that away.. then you do the math...

Let's say 5 devs / week spend 2 hours each to maintain some garbage. 5 \* 2 = 10 hrs/wk. Let's say each dev costs $150/hr (assuming company overhead like benefits and such are added in). That's $150\*10 = $1500/wk being **** away on this. Mutiply that by 52 weeks per year for simplicitty... $1500 \* 52 = $78,000 / year wasted maintaining this thing vs a 1 time cost of $10k.

Likewise, there's the opportunity cost.. devs **** away 10 hrs / wk on something means they aren't spending it on something else.

But, like you and I both know, it depends on the company culture and management. I found an issue at one job costing company $1M / year. Literally if we fixed the issue it would prevent $1M / year from being tossed on a bon fire. I thought that was a big deal. Nobody listened. A year goes buy, someone approaches me raving about it. I go ""oh, yeah.. I found that last year."" They chastised me for not bring it up. Um.. I did bring it up. ""Ok, but why didn't you make a bigger deal about it."" Um.. b/c telling folks we're bleeding $1M/yr doesn't require a **** d\*\*\* sales pitch. It pretty much sells itself. The company was a hot mess and went out of business after I left.

Usually devops will have a PM or Product Owner that's supposed to help translate all that work unit time and money and put together proposals, and work with the PMO to determine where the most bang for the buck would go. But, a lot of companies are just a hot mess. A lot of PM's are just glorified nannies. All they do is coordinate meetings and answer emails. They don't do gantt charts or do bottom-up or top-down project analysis.

So, if this **** falls to the devs, you have to translate your cost on the project and hours into cost and make it clear how it would be better to optimize code or to get rid of 15 code libs all doing the same and reduce it down to a few that are easier to support and maintain.

Also, force everyone to use coding conventions and don't let any dev use whatever pet code libs they want without some Quality Circle made up of folks from all the dev ops teams vetting it. Decision by committee sucks, but it beats having different dev dept's all doing their own things like cats and then an ""A"" team gets shifted to a diff projet while a ""B"" team has to fill in and has a huge learning curve on what the libs and junk they were doing.",-1,0.0

the usual(or maybe not). we keep interviews extremely casual and do not make them adversarial. we get people talking, feeling comfortable. small talk for a few minutes.  ask for background, etc. we talk a lot about what we do, what we're working on. what our problems are, what type of stuff you'd be doing.

get all that stuff out of the way. focus in on specific experiences on the resume, ask deeper and deeper questions, technically and more abstract about how they solved a problem, why they chose x over y? did you consider z? why or why not... typically this will organically lead into unexpected places w/ good candidates. BUT! you have to watch out for the bullshitters here b/c some people are very good hand-waving over the technical while still sounding like they know what they're talking about.

people will slowly reveal their understanding of fundamentals and whether or not they can apply that. where it gets good is if they can make connections between what they've done in the past w/ what we're doing and riff off that.

we also have a small take home (takes a few hours maybe) that we go over w/ candidates and they walk us through decisions and why they did what.

this is not to say we don't check technical knowledge but we don't do it by asking if you know x cmd.   We'd rather you know what to look for over just knowing the command to use so you can look there. you can google the cmd in 2 seconds...

last person we hired had much more generalized experience but his way of thinking was much more in line with how we solve problems.  His competition was extremely ops heavy(not a bad thing) except his resume and his conversations were all highly focused on very specific tasks, never mentioning(or understanding) how these tasks tied into the larger project. more so like he just grabbed tickets and closed them.

we hire for people who see big picture and can figure out how to get things done over the most technically solid candidate. 

there's really only one position we've required deep deep technical knowledge in and that's b/c it was a very niche specialty subject that we needed someone to have deep knowledge in.",9,0.7482762841175299

Besides more technical issues it comes down to its manageability, usability, and performance deficits that do not make up for its raw flexibility to do so many things. I commonly see that many organizations started with Jenkins about a decade or so ago when they didn’t have any real experience with CI nor their organization’s needs and capabilities. Along the journey many organizations have come to rely upon more specialized tools and identified their core needs to balance appropriately with the maintenance costs of their respective solutions.

Jenkins gives the most of any rope tools out there, no contest here. Most tools have structures to build bridges as first class citizens but Jenkins makes it easier to build more varieties of nooses than rope bridges and pulleys unless one willfully ignores the vast majority of documentation that exists (read: just use containers, try to avoid plugins, refrain from use of Groovy or pipeline / job definitions in any form, etc). Think of it similar to how PHP was viewed around 2011 by web developers - it was ridiculed yet clearly popular.

The (mis)use of Jenkins in the industry has soured many lower maturity organizations on CI/CD efforts that literally all high performance software and operational organizations use, and this great divide of organizational performance likely makes a lot of the survivors in this sub feel bitter about Jenkins’s role in cratering their efforts at the companies that have failed.",3,1.0

Everyone I meet, starting to learn k8s, gets lost in the details of how clusters are built and managed. 

My constant advice is to spend time on the technology in this order:

1. Spin up a cluster on Google, Azure or AWS (in that order of preference) and use a managed offering to first learn how the technology is designed to complement Docker. Learn all about Docker builds, Docker Registries how to deploy to k8s using Helm or Kustomize
1. Learn a tool like devspace or skaffold to make your life easier
1. Next spin up a cluster on you laptop for playtime (see k3d , minikube, kind, microk8s). You'll start to learn about DNS and ingress controllers. Most importantly you'll learn the limitations of running k8s on a single node.
1. Build your own bare metal clusters using one of the many options (my favourite being k3s)

I agree with people who advocate that Kubernetes can be overkill. If you only deploy your code on a single server, then that opinion is correct. The caution I give is that in today's world of cloud hosting infrastructure, single server deployments in production are very rare. 

Lastly, just like Docker has become a universal standard for packaging our software, I propose that Kubernetes is the complementary universal standard for deployment.

If everyone is trying to avoid your team then maybe you've become a blocker.  

Honestly the best use for folks with DevOps capabilities is to build platforms that allow development teams to self-service to the greatest amount possible.  

Make secrets easy to work with, the documentation readily available and spread institutional knowledge and you won't have teams checking keys into code.  

Don't give folks write access to the AWS console.  Force them to commit infrastructure as code and deploy via pipelines.  Make it easy for the team to deliver value but also create controls that enforce security policies.

Plus, with using libraries being so popular and easy these days, if you make one that's helpful, it can easily take off, giving fame/fortune/satisfaction.

If you've done it 10 times, you're probably aware of short-comings in the libraries, and therefore are in an excellent position to build a better library...

A library can be a copy of another library, just tweaked in implementation (faster) or interface (easier to use). But it can also be an entirely new approach to that kind of library (in implementation and/or API). Or, going a step further, it can solve a problem that has not been addressed at all, thus creating a new category of library. Or, it can be one part of a new approach to solving the problem - so everything else has to change, even though your library only addresses one part of it.

You can even make a startup based on a library - not an app at all (though certainly most of startups seem to be customer apps these days). ",-1,0.0

What do you mean by ""how DNS works""? To what level of depth & complexity? That could mean:
- UDP
- that it's actually application layer supporting network layer in a weird way
- the real world setup of dns (openssl cert stuff on the CLI)
- resolvers, cache, servers
- change propagation & expected delays when you change something
- that mostly everything points to CloudFlare's (1x) or google's (8x) which is public
- that you Can configure, and orgs often do for convenience's sake, your own internal TLD
- oh, or what about TLD and subrouting
- or about how the subrouting usually just happens by pointing to the same server and mapping it all in Nginx, so really, it's basically just a PATH nowadays unless maintained by the architect to split on convention
- or why does DNS use UDP and not TCP
- or why DNS has recently been considered a security leak 
- or how to configure DNS to be publicly accessible (I definitely don't, never have, and just use a service)

I don't even know what I could consider ""knowing how"" DNS works & not. I'm definitely no expert and consider it a weak area. But when you share your experience of ""all devops people are dumber than you'd expect"", I just don't really get any value out of reading such a vaguely constructed post. 

Normally, when people interview, they have a nasty tendency to only testing on their specific scope of information, and sizing up people that way. I for example can tour you through what i think are 3 fundamental layers of abstraction when it comes to git (it's just diffs, actually it's not, but actually it is) including commands for each layer to highlight the implications of this abstractive layering. But if I test someone on that, it's unlikely they'll be able to match parity with what I myself could answer, since I'm the one asking the questions.

I would implore you to consider the old adage ""if everywhere you go, it smells like shit"" in terms of ""if no one seems to be meeting your expectations, perhaps you have too high of expectations"".

Computer science can be wildly complicated and if you expect, as a casual or basic aside, someone to ""know how DNS works"",  and only pay $130k, you're going to have a bad time. 130k is not sufficient to pay for someone who off-hand studies 100-hr domain areas of 100s of different possible topics that are available to us in CS. You've got to specialize somewhat. And you've got to coordinate those specialities.

This cultural change can be met with resistance from employees who are accustomed to working independently within their own functional areas. It may take time and effort to build trust and encourage a mindset of shared responsibility for the entire software delivery process.
Another challenge is the complexity of integrating various tools and technologies across different stages of the software development lifecycle. Implementing DevOps practices often involves using a wide range of tools for automation, monitoring, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). Ensuring that these tools work seamlessly together and are properly integrated with existing systems can be a significant technical hurdle for many organizations. It requires careful planning, testing, and ongoing maintenance to achieve a well-functioning DevOps toolchain.",0,1.0

""Want to practice X? our tool does that too"". In practice you're always going to integrate your GitOps tooling with your CI/CD pipelines in some sense, but that doesn't mean everything you do in your CI/CD pipelines -- even if applying declarative IaC with terraform/pulumi -- is GitOps. Pushing is a mutation. Pulling is truly declarative. Tools like terraform and pulumi push. If that push fails because of a network partition, outage, temporary disruption -- that's the end of the automation line.

Second one points you to Argo CD, despite the overly broad prelude. Argo CD is GitOps -- you graft it onto your target platform and hook it up to your git origin. It finds declarative IaC and updates the platform its grafted onto. This is GitOps.

Kelsey Hightower is awesome and his explanation is on track until he kind of bungles the final tl;dr because he doesn't bother challenging common misconceptions. The declarative infrastructure is the key, not the term ""CI/CD"" which he's using in the more academic sense, not the colloquial sense we've been using of ""automation pipelines that live in your VCS"".

DevOps at the C level is a different ball game. My point is more relevant to the DevOps practice at the software delivery and management (development, testing, security, operations) level.  We don't need C level people to tell us how to work with our peers from the other teams.

In effect the use cases of DevOps teams should look like

1. Operations has a problem?? Sure, lets get together and find out how we can solve it and remove similar issues from all future releases.
2. Developers need an environment for poc?? Sure, lets understand the needs and put up reusable IaC scripts so that anyone can create and pull down environments independently. And in the process, improve speed of maintaining Production Environments. Make the scripts generic enough to provide flexibility so that it can be used for multiple use cases.

Instead, what do we see? Devs are complaining about DevOps, DevOps is complaining about OPs, Security, tools, vendor, etc etc.. Operations is still complaining about code.. And security felt left out of the spotlight, so they jumped in with DevSecOps without any clear understanding to muddy the waters by introducing restrictions on code, tools, services, etc under the garb of zero tolerance or whatever that BS term is.

Yep, I agree, I should have clarified. They padded up their salaries by ruining a lot of careers. The focus now is learning tools than the core concepts. And when they ""finally listened and understood"" the complains about too many tools, they now make you learn a new tool under the garb of consolidating everything with a single tool. OH ****..

Leadership didn't actually like to let people go, so they kept the admins on in good faith, thinking they bought into the vision of the company. The company was actually trying to be the ""good guy"" here and not have to force them into finding a new role. They told them well ahead of time what was coming down the pike, and they gave them the opportunity to jump ship in light of that. Nobody took the opportunity.

But, in the end, knowing Windows is a job skill just like any other. If they didn't want to cultivate that job skill, they should have been more forthcoming about that and started making the transition themselves. 

As for the database stuff, it was the exact some thing: It was a NoSQL XML database, and everything we were doing was storing XML metadata. We didn't have any out-and-out MySQL DBAs there, just ""server admin"" who might have leaned more towards the systems side or the database side.

So I have little choice if I want a somewhat native platform.

I find the pipelines relatively easy to work with, but most of the stuff I need to do is fairly straight forward and is easily tested (since most steps take little time to run and are somewhat non-destructive/reversible), it'd definitely be great to execute things locally first.

I've gotten to touch gitlab a few times and bitbucket/bamboo, but it all ended up to kind of skip the build phase since they don't do well building Microsoft .NET framework 6.x stuff without significant effort to create build servers etc. So it just wasn't worth the effort for what we needed (it's a lot of SaaS with relatively simple code bases, most of the ""value"" comes from configuration work)",-1,0.0

The problem is recruiters putting people who have kubernetes/helm on their resume into interviews with people who need to admin a kubernetes cluster the roles are vastly different. Helm and kubernetes makes it easy to get things done but they are difficult to manage properly. Similar to networking, easy to setup easy to **** up.

Proper training and focus
With knowledge comes to vision and expertise. Lack of vision can be easily handled when one has an idea about the goals and how to achieve it.
Bringing teams together
With collaboration between teams comes productivity. Would it not be a constant process that had the role of building code by developers and checking code quality by testers become a single transparent job? It is only possible when both the teams work together in constant collaboration.
Flexible tool orchestration options
The best way to omit the problem of tool integration is to find the right options for tool orchestration.
Power of analytics
The integration of tools can help us gather relevant data and put them into one central repository.

Cultural Shifts: Getting teams to work together instead of in separate groups can be hard. It means making sure everyone talks to each other, shares responsibilities, and helps each other out.
Tool Complexity: There are so many tools for different parts of the DevOps process. Making them all work together smoothly is tough.
Team Collaboration: It's important for developers and operations teams to work well together. But they often have different ways of doing things. Finding good ways for them to communicate and work together is key.
Other big challenges include:
Automation: Making sure things happen automatically without making the system too complicated.
Scaling Up: As a company grows, make sure the tools and processes can handle the growth without needing big changes.
Security and Rules: Keeping everything secure and following all the rules without slowing down the work.
Watching and Improving Performance: Making sure the software runs well and fixing problems without stopping the work.
Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD): Setting up systems that automatically test and send out new versions of the software without causing problems.
Old Systems and Debt: Updating old systems and dealing with old problems can be hard. Bringing DevOps into old systems needs careful planning.
To solve these challenges, companies need to use their tech skills, make their processes better, and change the way people work together. But if they can do it, they'll be able to release new software faster, make it better, and be more flexible as a business.",0,1.0

So they should make their jobs harder to make your job easier? If your code breaks something at 4am, is it you that will have to wake up to fix it - or them? I think you're missing an important point of ""DevOps"": communication between dev and ops.

I’ve never felt Scrum (sprint and point planning) do any good, or at least I’ve never seen anyone do it well. Point planning is never right, businesses change priorities every other month etc.

Story points are not part of Scrum, first off.  They were invented by Ron Jeffries and his team at Chrysler in an attempt to abstract away estimates from meddling by managment.  They'd tried ""ideal developer days"" only to have management conflate them as ""actual days"" and hold their feet to the fire, so they changed the name.  User Stories and Story Points come from Extreme Programming (XP), not Scrum.

And if business priorities change every other month, that's a argument FOR Scrum, because that just means every 2-6 iterations your Product Goal changes.  None of which is to say Scrum is necessarily always the best choice, but if we're going to criticize it, let's be accurate about what it is and isn't.

>I agree Agile should be each team doing what works for them, but I’ve never seen that. I’ve always seen “we have to do scrum, with sprints and points and daily stand ups and never once question if it really works for us or not.”

So what you're saying is we have a problem with incompetent meddling management and developers who want to ""just code"" and be pushed around like chess pieces, rather than participate in making decisions.  I don't disagree.  For all the ""Agile is dead"" **** going around LinkedIn, it seems more like good Agile just can't survive contact with apathetic devs, micromanaging middle management, and egotistical executives, which really shouldn't surprise anyone.

My mother was waiting for months to undergo a very serious examination in Germany and ended up coming back to Bulgaria and had it done in 3 days.

A lot of DevOps is aimed at removing the silos of devs and ops and trying to, essentially, give devs the keys to the infrastructure and pipeline so they can be more efficient. The cold reality is that's not really possible to fully do in most situations. The old Ops roles like sysadmins existed because there is simply *so much* overhead involved. Knowing the tools, maintaining the systems, monitoring, etc. it all takes time.

DevOps philosophy is in some ways looking for unicorns. As automation improves and cloud has grown, its core goal seems near achievable and maybe in the near future it will be as more things integrate, but for now, it still takes specialized focus to roll out infrastructure. That means asking developers to be masters of so much software and skillsets that it's just not realistic for them to fully do both Dev and Ops at high level.

So, my point is, you have to come to terms with *why* DevOps as an ideal is not really being achieved by companies. The workloads to reach the ideal are still too high, but that might not be the case in another five years.",0,1.0

I’m not sure I can do that here, but it would be incredible to come up with a better approach to interviews or evaluations that actually works.

I’ve taken online coding tests—some went great, some not so much. I’ve interviewed with Google and Microsoft, and while some of those interviews went exceptionally well, others didn’t. The biggest flaw in these testing processes, in my opinion, is that they tend to focus on measuring very specific technical skills or quantifiable knowledge. But in reality, neither of those are strong indicators of success.

Where I truly excel—potentially more than most, based on my experience—is bridging the gap between technical teams and business or operational groups. I absolutely love helping people find solutions. Because I’m so passionate about technology, I enjoy finding ways to make it easier for developers to meet business goals. It’s genuinely one of my favorite things to do.

Now that I think about it, that’s probably how I should lead in interviews, resumes, and everything else.

I've primarily worked in the UK, but also worked in the Netherlands, Germany and Cyprus. Not once have I ever been expected to work beyond my 9-5 monday to friday.

One UK employer had a voluntary on-call rota of 1 week on, 3 weeks off. 7pm-7am  monday to friday and all weekend. But callouts were less than 1 per week (I'd get called out maybe once every two times I was on rota) and for volunteering you got a 20k boost to your salary. So competition to be on the on-call team was high.

My salary in the UK is roughly £123k GBP (155k usd), including bonus and stocks, i got my full bonus this year without any issue.

I have private medical and dental cover, although private medical care here still goes via the NHS for primary care, it's essentially the extras that go via the private cover.

That puts me well beyond 99% of UK employees in terms of salary, and my quality of life reflects that, I own my own house in a nice area, and my wife and I can afford to live with luxuries, hobbies, holidays etc. Compared to the vast majority of the UK this puts me in a position of priviledge.

I also get 33 days off per year, 2 months sick pay, 8% pension matching on my 6% contribution (tax free) - last year I ended up taking most of a month off on holiday and my wife and I travelled.

There's also the small perks, work pays for my spotify, youtube premium, amazon prime video, that sort of thing.

I've worked primarily in the tech sector, but moved to fintech a couple of years ago. I have US colleagues as I work for an international company and their work life balance is insanely skewed by comparison. I'm sure their salaries are higher, especially the ones working in LA, but I wouldn't trade places with them.",4,0.749859991555653

Although DevOps teams may face many challenges with the tools themselves (there are soo many and the learning curve is high), the hardest part is always the company culture and mindsets of people. Believe it or not, most people don’t like change. So adopting a new mindset, habits, rules and principles are the real challenges.
For example, how to make sure you align on technology/business decisions among teams? How to make sure everybody is multi-skilled? “I’m a Ops guy, I will not write code!” or “I’m a Java programmer, I’m not going to learn JavaScript!”. “What? I need to write tests myself, are you joking?” And do developers really want on pager-duty? Are we really deploying code to production without a DTAP process (read: manual verifications)?
Just some random quotes and questions that have nothing to do with technology, but need to be addressed if you want to build a true DevOps culture.

To me, DevOps is someone who understands the whole stack- the java code backing the REST web service, the database servers, the networking, switching, load balancing, and storage.  DevOps is enough of a developer to create ""glue"" to get all the tabs and slots connected, help the developers understand the other pieces their code needs to talk to, and help QA triaging problems.

Note, this has _nothing_ to do with today's outage, not even ""wink, wink - nudge, nudge"" -- as an example:

Summary:

foo.example.bar was offline for 23 minutes due to a failure to renew the SSL certificate, affecting approximately 380 customers and failing 44K requests. CSRs received 21 support cases, 3 from top-shelf customers.

Root cause:

certbot logging filled the /opt/ volume, causing tmpfile creation to fail. certbot requires tmpfiles to do <x>.

What went well:

- The frobulator had a different cert, so customers didn't notice for some time.

Where we got lucky:

- The frobulator had a different cert, but had it expired first this would have led to worse outcome X.

What went poorly

- This is the second time our cert expired without us noticing.
- Renewal took longer than expected, as `certbot autorenew` was failing.

AIs:

- P0: renew cert [done]
- P1: survey all existing certs for near-future renewals
- P1: setup cert expiry monitoring
- P1: setup certbot failure monitoring
- P2: catalog all certs with renewal times / periods in spreadsheet
- P3: review disk monitoring metrics and decide if we need more aggressive alerting",2,0.5041130443732909

Idea being that organisations that improve faster will, over time, overtake organisations that improve slower. If so, it makes sense to focus on the improvement loop itself. You remove management from the loop (because management takes too long and slows down improvement) and you empower and encourage individual contributors within their teams to improve the process because they can do it faster, have hands on knowledge of the process and can observe results faster.Additional benefit of Agile is that you now have a tightly knit team that tends to be more engaged with their work and more focused on thinking through what they are doing -- this tends to cause people to be more satisfied with their jobs because satisfaction of being able to affect the process positively is a great motivator.Yet, the management thinks they can come with a book and institute ""Agile process"" by telling everybody what they have to do, exactly.Usually, improvement within team structure is then actively discouraged with many explanations like ""that's not what the book says"" or ""I was doing scrum at a company where it worked and so we must do the same"" or ""we need to standardise processes"" or some other variation of it.I have observed this time and time again at various stages -- always with the same miserable outcome.At my last company they additionally decided we are introducing Scaled Agile Framework meaning, according to them, we will now plan not at team structure but at a department level. This innovation means all planning and retrospective are combined for about 400 people. Because this was too time consuming to do every two weeks, they decided we will do this every 5 sprints (10 weeks). Just to be clear -- every 5 sprints we were supposed to select and plan tickets for the next 10 weeks of development. This was presented as an efficiency improvement.",13,1.0

This is a very common mistake I've seen around Microsoft- believing that because you've granted someone a title of ""developer"" and put them in charge of developing a systems management or systems automation task, they are not doing operations.

Maybe you should post a job description asking for a SRE, that is more ""support"" than a DevOPS. Or maybe looking for a Senior Admin knowing some Terraform and CI stuff?
Maybe is what you are looking for that you don't know or doesn't understand. In fact, 90% of people hiring DevOPS doesn't know what a **** DevOPS do lol.
BTW, 130k is pretty much a average salary for a DevOPS, nothing special.",0,0.9847481388151179

Like Agile before it, which was a set of practices and beliefs focused on making software developers being more involved with the business so that together they could deliver better solutions, but instead was co-opted by managers (all those **** certifications and scaled agile frameworks is one example) as a way of controlling all the tiny steps involved in delivering value with software.

DevOps now is mostly a very poorly defined role that means more or less System Administrator but now with more fancy tools and lots of automation.

There are plenty of success cases of DevOps practices being properly adopted in companies and where People > Processes > Tools actually means something. But in a lot of places, DevOps is seen as a magic bullet just like Scrum was, where people think that if you adopt the processes and tools things will magically fix themselves. The most important part, which is having the right people with the right mindset of continuous feedback, self-improvement and that create and foster an culture of openness, well… that’s just too **** hard work, so go back to your Jenkins and fix that pipeline ASAP, some manager just promised something unrealistic to someone and now it’s up to you to deliver.",13,0.47461792782373524

I test and debug my own code, who else would? The problem is that when I was hired, there were dedicated QA to really dig in and tear apart code. To test how new features impact the system as a whole, to think of test scenarios I can't. Now they abolish that role and simple increase all the developers responsibilities without increasing the size of the team or reducing release scope.

As far as automation goes, developers have always written automated unit tests. No problem, it's necessary and I think unit tests are kinda cool. When I say they want us to automate testing I mean writing selenium ui tests from the ground up. And come up with automated deployment systems. Both of these are fine, and necessary. But this is on a product years in development that has none of this and they aren't giving us official time to work on it in the sprint. They want us to just find the time. That is the problem.

I want my product to succeed and I work hard to make sure that happens. We are even somehow finding the time to do all this stuff I talked about above. The problem is that it is exhausting, for all of us. Does it count as failure if the business has unrealistic expectations of us? We are a team, but every team member shouldn't be expected to fill every role. The quarterback has to run the ball sometimes, but that isn't his main responsibility or even what he is really trained to do. (maybe not the most well worded metaphor, I'm not a sports guy :)

Actually, I don't, given the situation-- I mentioned it earlier: 

The business was trying to be really sensitive to the current workers they had. They realized that in our area infrastructure/admin folks still have issues getting placed in new jobs. As a dev I personally could literally have a job two weeks from today, but we're talking more along the lines of 1-2 months minimum for an admin to complete his or her job search.

Long story short, they were and remain the biggest pain for everyone.

NB: I think you already have a Call (markdown->Word), that you should do first; this is a later/secondary one.

**Intrinsic**: markdown already looks like what it will be rendered as, e.g. `*emphasis*` -> *emphasis*, so it is intuitive and readable - much more so that html or other markup syntax. This makes it intuitive to work with.

**Extrinsic**: Most important: because of reddit (and I think other forums?), markdown has become know to the mainstream (or at least, a wide range of people) - it has a kind of installed base; it's become something of a standard. [This is similar to what happened with html: all programmers knew it. Therefore, when XML was introduced, it was already familiar and understood, a small step. Thus, XML became a standard).

The above makes markdown easier for *non-programmers* to use. Especially domain experts - the actual users.

But I think the next step isn't evaluating expressions (which is a programmer kind of thing), but: what tasks do users actually need to do in a template? And what would be intuitive for them?

I think very common would be looping e.g. tables with multiple rows, and conditionals, e.g. different forms for singular, plural (and perhaps none). Java has a bunch of classes for this in its text formatting package - this is used for internationalization. So, another ""switch"" could be which language is being used; and also for different documents or letters.

One way to intuitively represent these:

1. have a table be *implicitly* multiply-valued. You map its values from an array/list.
2. for conditionals, use a form like: `kilogram/s`, and implicitly map the first word before `/` to singular and the second extended version to plural.  If you have three, the first one is for zero (but you may need a whole phrase, not just one word, so more syntax is needed to delimite the phrase, not just a word boundary. *All* such syntax is unintuitive and unfamiliar to non-programmers.... whereas `kilogram/s` is already known)
3. have different files, with the filename indicating the language or type of document - users will need to find out what names they should use, but this seems reasonable, especially if the names are reasonable. e.g. `english.txt,` `french.txt`... (but even `EN.txt`, `FR.txt` is at least understandable).  It's even more intuitive for document type, e.g. `invoice.md`, `receipt.md`, `purchaseorder.md`. If you need to vary on both paramaters (or more), could use nested directories, with directory names being language, and filename being doc type. e.g. `french/invoice.md`

But all of that stuff is a little unituitive, so I'd start with just `$variable`. Once users are used to that, it's very easy for them to accept more advanced stuff - especially when they need it.

Technically, the big picture here is: classes (showing what can be repeated; what polymorhphic choices exist); format (the choices, lists and values in the template, as above); and mapping (where to get those values from in the classes, where to get the lists, choices).

Anyway, as I said, I wouldn't recommend doing this first, as it's a big can of worms, lots of work to do. I mainly wanted to communicate how I saw it *from a user point of view* - that markdown templates are a big win *for users*. A Call. They could revolutionize how templates are done.

But a Call isn't really about what actual users want (or even what they *would* want, if only they knew about it). It's about what *you* feel is valuable. What Calls *you*.",-1,0.0

Sure,  if my devs were better at writing Dockerfiles and understood Kubernetes, there'd be less to do, but if just do more projects around improving security scanning, adding better runtime metrics, etc.

Beyond this,  my team's long range vision includes making improvements to standard packages that our dev teams would use to cut down boilerplate, and keeping a mind more in the game on how these services will scale and what we need to enable that. 

 My experience has shown me that a shockingly few number of Devs care at all about the infrastructure. I don't mean the servers,  I mean all of it.  They want better development environments, automation, and durable deployments,  but they don't really want to *do* it.

Here are some of the key obstacles organizations face:
1. Cultural Resistance
A DevOps transformation impacts the entire organization, not just IT. Moving from traditional roles to a collaborative DevOps model often meets resistance, especially from teams unfamiliar with DevOps practices. Overcoming this requires a cultural shift toward shared responsibilities and open communication.
2. Maintaining Consistency and Standardization
Scaling DevOps means managing multiple teams, processes, and tools across the organization. Ensuring that all teams adhere to standardized practices, policies, and tooling can be challenging, particularly in decentralized or remote setups.
3. Tool Integration and Complexity
DevOps often involves integrating numerous tools for automation, monitoring, testing, and deployment. As the organization grows, the complexity of managing and coordinating these tools increases, making it essential to maintain interoperability and effective toolchain management.
4. Automating Complex Workflows
While automation is a core part of DevOps, creating effective automated pipelines for large-scale, complex systems is challenging. Automation requires thoughtful planning, script maintenance, and monitoring, and scaling these workflows across teams can be resource-intensive.
5. Ensuring Security and Compliance
As DevOps expands, maintaining security and compliance becomes more complex. Ensuring that all automated workflows adhere to security policies, compliance regulations, and data privacy laws is critical but difficult, requiring continual monitoring and auditing.
6. Managing Legacy Systems
Many organizations have legacy systems that aren’t compatible with modern DevOps practices, making it difficult to integrate these systems into DevOps pipelines. Legacy systems often require custom approaches to automation and monitoring, which can slow down adoption.
7. Skill Gaps and Training
Scaling DevOps requires skilled teams capable of handling everything from automation scripting to cloud management and security. Ensuring that all team members are adequately trained and equipped with the necessary skills is essential but challenging, especially in rapidly evolving environments.
8. Monitoring and Observability
With larger deployments, visibility into applications and infrastructure becomes critical to maintain reliability. Scaling observability practices—ensuring that performance metrics, logs, and error tracking are comprehensive and actionable—can become increasingly complex with more resources and services.
Conclusion
Scaling DevOps practices requires a strategic approach, starting with fostering a collaborative culture, investing in automation, and focusing on training. Overcoming these challenges can lead to a more agile, efficient development process that keeps pace with an organization’s growth.",0,1.0

I've seen platform teams devolve into managing VM updates by hand, babysitting operating systems of every application deployed because it's treated as a long living pet, and it gets worse when team leads move on and then someone else comes in and half bakes their own flavor of change. Even better when networking gets involved, load balancing with HA where people roll their own solution. On top of that is the certificate story and how that gets managed. Don't even start with RBAC from a platform perspective, it's a nightmare. The toil filled platform days should be behind us. Plenty of companies are slow to evolve and you can find a lot of pain.Perhaps I've had bad luck in my history of being a network engineer, infrastructure engineer, and an SRE. The one big benefit to these tools that are coming out is it can give some sort of standardization and it's giving you a ton of power in abstraction so that platform teams aren't micromanaging things that are just sorted for you.Something like Kubernetes gives you load balancing, high availability, RBAC, networking and routing, resource management, node draining and rotations, auto scaling. Sure it's managed in yaml manifests, but it's doing a lot of lifting. I won't say that the abstraction can't bite you, you still need to understand the core concepts of things. However people should be understanding those concepts regardless.The amount of work that takes for a small team at a startup that needs to scale services is immense without it. Right now I'm working with a 3 man platform team and we are running over 200 services in multiple regions, multiple database technologies and analytics stacks, we auto scale aggressively and we serve over a billion requests and terabytes of traffic a month with over 99.99% of uptime. We also deal with operations, security and every other hat that someone wants to throw our way. The metrics solutions to come out of this are also such a huge win, I remember the days of Nagios, Zabbix, SolarWinds etc. They were mostly static graphs showing you snapshots of what happens at a very high level, now we have metrics for everything and you can feed that into anything to self-remediate or escalate. I absolutely love it and can't wait to see it evolve more!The previous iteration of platform at this company was all self-managed VMs with the old school sysadmin mindset. They were managing hundreds of VMs by hand or using some light ansible that was retrofitted to work with pre-existing machines, we were using corporate F5 load balancers and VMware which are immediately out of date the moment you deploy them. Some older sysadmins were legitimately afraid of rebooting servers because they were afraid they wouldn't come back. Some machines had over 900 days of uptime because they just couldn't keep up with the toil. Also this creates a wall between the platform and developers because it turns into a hand-off process where developers throw code over and the platform team has to implement some server and load balance logic, let alone meeting SLO/SLI criteria. Sadly, that's not uncommon to any industry. This team had 15+ people and had trouble keeping up let alone deploy and innovate. Outages in this mode are unavoidable, and pulling away from that old school mindset and starting over is VERY hard.I'm sure a lot of that can be contributed to bad management and bad hires, however from my perspective using tooling and standardization will only help you build a platform that can actually grow. Making that predictable and easy to digest is important, and so is understanding the details underneath. I just know I will never want to go back to 2015 or anytime before. I'll babysit kubernetes node issues or upgrade woes all day if that's what it takes (not that I need to).Granted this isn't the case at FAANG, they've got the brain power to build a consistent platform regardless. Everyone below that though benefits greatly.",12,0.6713213314373306

Second, start attacking your workflow. How do your developers prioritize work at the moment? does a project manager keep track of all the todo's and assign them out? figure out what that workflow looks like and then find a system that helps do that.. it could be a google sheet, it could be jira.. don't pick a tool and then force a workflow pattern, figure out what the workable pattern looks like and then find a tool to help.. 

once you have that down, start finding the most people intensive, tedious things that can be automated, and its probably gonna be builds. something like jenkins can really help you there. 

once you have that nailed down you can branch out into config management with things like chef/puppet and take a ton of the human interaction out of provisioning systems.. 

eventually you can even start tying all those things together, a jenkins job maybe, that spins up a vm, runs your config mgmt stuff on it, deploys your builds.

what you DONT want to do is re-design the workflow for maximum optimization, and then enforce it on your team.. they will reject it and you.. what you DO want to do, is get in the trenches with them, experience the current workflow, understand whats good about it, whats bad about it, and how it got where it is now, and build something that address pain points.. they will adopt it if you come to them and say ""hey i made a thing for you that makes this particular pain point not hurt so bad"".",-1,0.0

(What pipeline tools do you use?),"Imagine a 10-car locomotive that was retrofitted to run on city streets and used to deliver pizzas.

Every single best practice for modern systems is foreign to Jenkins. Configuration as code is a plug-in, it depends on writing everything to a filesystem, the jobs are either XML or a weird variant of Java, there's an entirely different job format needed just to load jobs when the server starts, none of the configuration changes are versioned, and all the millions of plugins you need to do basic things are chronically insecure or broken. The teams maintaining it end up breaking it more as they try to improve parts. Doing anything is 50x harder than it should be, and it's always breaking.

Jenkins is the single best example of why you want a modern, cloud-native design. Find a solution that has versioned config changes, simple jobs, uses a database for state, and requires as few plugins as possible.

I personally love Drone.io. It's not free for commercial use but it is the single best experience I've ever had with CI tools and it's the best design I've ever seen for any cloud-native app. It's the easiest tool I've ever set up and it's the easiest experience for developers, it's the easiest to maintain and has integrations for difficult 3rd party stuff.

There's no other choice in this sort of a change.  Switching from \*NIX to Windows is *not* like switching from, say, .NET to Java. It takes *years* of constant, dedicated effort to make that sort of transition (in terms of administrative skillset). Was your company offering paid training?  Were they offering pay increases?  Were they offering supplemental resources?

No. They gave these guys 6-8 months -- **without reduced workload** -- to pick up Windows to the level they knew Linux. It *was* a giant ""go **** yourself, we don't care about your concerns"".

I get that you don't see it -- but that's exactly what it was. 6-8 months isn't even enough time to transition a middling company from *NIX to Windows ... which by the way would in and of itself require significant increase in workload from the very self-same people who you're asking to learn the new setup.

I say it again; whoever at your company expected to use the same personnel for Windows as they had been using w/ Linux should be taken out back and shot.  Whoever thought that 6-8 months was sufficient time to transition should be taken out back, shot in the knees, beaten with a rubber hose, and hung by his ankles over a wasp's nest as a warning to others.  That's just grossly negligent.

I say it again: it's not that they *refused*. It's that they *couldn't*. (Not in the time given, with the workload demands made of them.)  If you respected how your management handled this, that just says you don't understand the scope of the magnitude of the change that was being asked to be made.

EDIT:  FYI, I was originally expecting to hear a short-term number for time for transition, but I expected that number to be 2-3 years.  Six to eight months?  That's just malicious.",-1,0.0

At some point years ago I started realising that most problems in SNMP are stemming from badly implemented SNMP agents. Those problems can be:1. Returning values different than what the MIB says.2. Missing values that are not optional in the MIB.3. Broken getnext code that returns an incorrect oid, which could even lead to loops. Net-snmp will detect it, but proper snmpwalk gets broken.4. Broken getbulk repeater code that can cause crashes if the repeater is too large.5. OIDs that will crash/stall/slow the agent.6. Implementations that cannot handle simultaneous requests. Admittedly this is notoriously difficult to achieve: most MIB implementation code is not reentrant for various reasons.7. SNMP SET is very difficult to implement, cannot be meaningfully used for almost anything beyond extremely simple stuff.8. UDP encapsulation can cause MTU/fragmentation issues that are a nightmare to debug. Net-snmp actually implemented transports such as TCP and it was very nice, but it never caught on in general.Bonus, there is also the not related to implementation problem of:9.

The fact that companies were buying into the whole devops teams per project instead of at the entetprise was really good for putting a rocket under hiring needs and salaries,  but outcomes were butchered.

My career has been funny as I began SRE with an infra that was on physical machines, then migrated into containers, then into Cloud, then into k8s. That’s several platform changes where we had to learn the ropes real quick and the pace of change was crazy.

But the architecture we reached at the end of that (k8s, git ops deployment, simple container builder flow, cloud native services) was really great. The company at the time (~900 people) still had a lot of infra that took effort to look after but the new stuff was legit and much simpler than the old systems had been.

I moved to a start-up and setup their infra for the first time, using those same new technologies and best practices learned from several cycles adopting and evolving the tools at my previous role. The tools are really mature nowadays and generally much higher performance and reliability than everything was 10 years ago, and GCP allows for a fair amount of self-service.

We put effort into keeping things simple, use few tools well, prefer to buy over build. All that means we only need two SREs to balance an engineering team of ~25 which is a ratio we never could’ve supported with previous generations of infra tooling.

Basically, I think the tools out nowadays are really really good, and most of the stress you describe comes from legacy at existing companies. There’s a chance that companies started today may have a way better time than the last decade now we’ve stabilised on k8s and cloud tooling and aren’t replatforming continually.",-1,0.0

TDD also tends to make much nicer, neater code in my experience.

This environment was always a heterogeneous environment. These ops guys in particular had already been hired because they had experience with Windows, Linux, Solaris, and OS X. They were also supposed to have experience in LAMP stacks, as well as IIS. That's not that unusual in the area I work in. 

That's what I'm trying to convey here. It's not like we had a bunch of grizzled AIX guys going from zero to experts. The expectation was *always* that the workload was about 30/70 Windows/Linux, and with the change, the next 6-8 months were going to be moving 40/60, on to 50/50, then eventually 80/20 at the end of about 2 years. Additionally, our corporate IT infrastructure was *entirely* Windows (AD, Exchange, MOM, SQL Server to support some of those operations), and many of the guys helped on that end, too. 

This company was great because these guys never really had that huge of workload. They were always under-utilized. We had gotten the Linux product to a stable state where not much was needed, and there weren't many (if any) additional releases coming out, nor were we onboarding new clients to those platforms. 

So... I don't know if I can convince you, but the expectation was that they already were supposed to be doing Windows work, and while their Windows workload was going up, their Linux workload was to be going down. Additionally, the *initial* transition time of 6-8 months was just that-- initial. It wasn't just flipping a switch and suddenly they were 100% Windows guys. 

I hate to be like ""you weren't there, man"", but this is one situation where I really stand by my statement: This company was trying to do right by their customers and listen to what they wanted, but at the same time try to do right by their current employees by not so much having them change skill sets, but having them transition into using more of a skill set they'd already been expected to have. And it wasn't like they ever were pushing them out the door; they were just letting them know ahead of time what was coming down the road, and that if they didn't want to be a part of that, they could start preparing to move on. Instead, many didn't prepare to move on, they stuck around and were impediments to the process. So they took up headcount (keeping us from hiring more folks in), AND they really weren't that useful in the transition. ",-1,0.0

Why aren't you getting into it? Do you want to? Do you have questions? Let's chat, let's compare notes, let's help each other.","I'm an experienced sysadmin who's interested in DevOps but just haven't taken the plunge to get really into it. I've read The Phoenix Project (and loved it), reviewed the DevOps roadmap ([https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)), and gained a basic high-level/theoretical understanding of many DevOps tools (Ansible, Terraform, ARM templates/Bicep, Pulumi, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.). I love learning about all the tools are and how they can be used to automate solutions. 

There are more books I want to read and I know I could start trying to use the tools in a home lab. But I don't quite feel driven to do it yet. I worry that to switch from typical enterprise sysadmin work to DevOps, I would have to take more of a junior DevOps position and a pay cut. This might be wrong, but I can't help but feel worried about it. 

Also, I suspect a lot of DevOps jobs are fully remote, but there are very few opportunities locally for me. This isn't a big deal, but again, just another thing that feels like it's inhibiting me.

I feel like I'd love a switch from traditional sysadmin work to either DevOps or a security job, so DevSecOps sounds really appealing to me. I'm tired of all the manual work I see in enterprise environments, so a culture focused on automation sounds like a dream.

But I've spent so much time learning on-prem and cloud solutions from Microsoft. It would feel so wrong to abandon a lot of it and switch to DevOps (or even a security focused role, for that matter). I think it's just a matter of time until I do switch, but again, just hard to take that chance without something lighting a fire underneath me to do it.

Take the NFL draft as an analogy, specifically for quarterbacks. It’s widely believed that over 50% of first-round quarterbacks don’t end up being successful. Why? It’s not because they lack skills or talent. It’s because you can’t predict how those skills or talent will translate in the real world—how they’ll fit with a specific team, a specific system, under specific coaches, and so on. You only know how well they’ll work once you put them into that unique environment.

The same principle applies to DevOps. I might be an incredibly effective DevOps resource—able to solve problems others can’t, transcending technology stacks, programming languages, operating systems, and more. But could I nail a DevOps interview? Absolutely not. Why? Because the real-world essence of DevOps isn’t about regurgitating known facts or definitions. It’s about navigating ambiguity, dealing with intangible and poorly defined challenges, and coming up with practical operational solutions for problems that don’t have clear answers in advance.

In my experience, you can’t ask highly specific, technical questions in an interview and expect that to translate into operational success on the job. The skills required in an interview are completely different from those needed in a real-world DevOps environment.

Instead, I believe hiring for DevOps should focus less on technical trivia and more on personality, adaptability, communication skills, and experience. I’d structure the process like this:
	1.	Screen candidates based on a basic skill set, but focus primarily on their personality, how they communicate, and how they interact with others.
	2.	Hire with a probationary period (e.g., 60-90 days) to see how they perform in the real-world environment.
	3.	During this probation, assess how well they collaborate, learn, and adapt—key traits that matter far more than their ability to recite the differences between C++ and C#, configure a switch, or write a Python script off the top of their head.

The reality is that DevOps is about working across teams, disciplines, and technologies. It’s not about knowing everything but about knowing how to navigate and integrate everything. An individual’s ability to collaborate, think critically, and communicate effectively with diverse groups is far more valuable than their ability to answer isolated technical questions.

To summarize, hiring for DevOps isn’t about screening people out—it’s about screening a few people in and observing how they perform in practice. The goal should be to identify individuals who fit well within your team and have the mindset to thrive in the collaborative, unpredictable world of DevOps. Everything else—tools, processes, languages—can be learned if the person has the right foundation.",0,1.0

I very much get the point that sometimes the person that wrote the code is sometimes too close to the problem to write good edge case tests.

And so there is some value to having a separate QA team.

But it is also a complete and utter **** show once you have a development team that believes that it's _not their job_ to identify or catch problems with their code, and if the QA team blesses the results it's the QA team's fault when it all blows up.

The _attitudes_ that splitting things up sometimes causes can be completely and utterly toxic to the goal of having a product that actually works.

There's a bug?  Great, the developer's job is to figure out what it is, _write a test case to reproduce the bug_, fix the bug, make sure that the test case confirms that the bug is fixed, and make nice clean commits to fix the problem and add the test case to the test suite.  And then to work with the team through any code review.

If that code blows up in production, the developers who wrote it _also_ need to be involved in tracking it down and fixing it.  Not just a developer on the team, but the ones that wrote _that_ code.

The rest of the alerting was mostly handled by a custom inhouse /__status end point parser.> The previous iteration of platform at this company was all self-managed VMs with the old school sysadmin mindset. They were managing hundreds of VMs by hand or using some light ansible that was retrofitted to work with pre-existing machines, we were using corporate F5 load balancers and VMware which are immediately out of date the moment you deploy them.That, again, is just bad sysadmin. Unless you have complete control over your stack with ansible, then its not ansible, its just sparkling bash script.I worked at a VFX company that deployed to all real machines for virtually everything. They used a GNU configuration system that was older than SSH (I can't remember what its called, it used to use rsh, that's how old it was.) All the machines were fungible, We could replace a file server at the drop of a hat (the only limit was how fast we could copy 160tbs over 2x10gig nics) Most of the place ran on perl, in one git repo for just configuration. OS updates were applied weekly, and we pushed system changes daily. This was in 2013.salt made all of that easier, especially as we had way too many hosts to sensibly run ansible at the time(I think we worked out it would take >1day to run a basic role).They had automated it to the point that you could plug in an unconfigured blade host, turn it on, and within 30 minutes, the bios was updated, networking configured and each blade was starting to be installed.Automation is an attitude.

Well agreed, but then admins shouldn't decide which version of say JBoss of WebSphere is installed on the base of that they have to learn how to administer it, while in reality there's nothing they understand about it and all they ever do is run a script to restart the **** thing, or maybe do some (bogus) configuration of things they think they understand but don't actually do.

I've seen places where admins/ops were hired to administer WebSphere and admins being good admins they were hiding all the configuration from the developers. So with did the developers do? The were shipping another application server inside the application that was deployed to WebSphere. So this entire WebSphere thing was reduced to just a dumb http connector and all real configuration was inside the embedded application server of which the admin knew nothing.

So these admins took great pride in having configured WebSphere and having configured its services (whatever that means), but the actual application running on the **** thing didn't use any of that configuration and didn't use any of those services.

Admin took also great pride in denying upgrade requests and boosting about not having upgraded the application server for years, therefor ensuring maximum stability.

In reality, upgrades of the ""real"" application server happened with pretty much every deploy of the application :O

You'd say that after some time some admin must have seen that none of the changes to the WebSphere config had ANY effect on the running of the application in question, but I don't think the dev team ever heard anything about it.

Let's take a moment to feel the pain of their devops team","Mainly by inspecting monitoring and logs.  And you don't need a ton of preparation, but even just some monitoring (things like qps, error rate, group-by service and other similar filters are bare minimum, more metrics is usually better, and a way to store history and render graphs is a big help), will help make diagnosis easier to narrow in on, but at some point the logs of what happened before and during failure will usually be looked at.  These logs keep track of what the server binary was doing, like notes of what is going as expected and what was error or unexpected.  With some expertise, knowledge of what the server is responsible for, and maybe some attempts at recreating the problem (if the pressure of getting a solve isn't too strong).

Usually the first thing to do is undo what is causing the problem.  It's not always as easy as rolling back a release to a previous version, especially if records were written or if the new configuration makes changing configs again harder.  But you want to stop the failures as soon as possible and then dig into the details of what went wrong.

Basically, an ounce of prevention (and a dash of inspection) are equal to 1000 pounds of cure.  The people responsible for designing and building the system discuss what could go wrong, and there's some risk/reward in the decision process, and you have to hope you're right about severity and possibility of different kinds of failures... but even the most cautious developer will encounter system failure, you can't completely control the reliability of dependencies (like auth, file system, load balancers, etc.) and even if you could, no system is 100% reliable: all systems in any significant use will fail, the best you can do is prepare well enough to spot the failure and be able to diagnose it quickly, release slowly enough that outages don't take over the whole system, but fast enough that you can recover/roll-back with some haste.

A lot of failures aren't intentional, they can be as simple as a typo in a configuration file, where nobody thought about what would happen if someone accidentally made a small edit with large effect range.  Until it happens and then someone will write a release script or sanity check that assures no change affects more than 20% of entities, or something like that, you know, that tries to prevent the same kind of failure.

Oh, and another big point is coordination.  In Google, and probably all big tech companies now, there's an Incident Response protocol, a way to find out who is currently on-call for a specific service dependency and how to contact them, an understanding of the escalation procedure, and so on.  So when an outage is happening, whether it's big or small, there's more than one person digging into graphs and logs, and the people looking at it are in chat (or if chat is out, IRC or phone or whatever is working) and discussing the symptoms observed, ongoing efforts to fix or route around it, resource changes (adding more workers or adding compute/memory to workers, etc.), and attempting to explain or confirm explanations.  More people may get paged during the incident but it's typically very clear who is taking on each role in finding and fixing the problem(s) and new people joining in can read the notes to get up to speed quickly.

Without the tools and monitoring preparation, an incident could easily take much much longer to resolve.  Without the coordination it would be a circus trying to resolve some incidents.",-1,0.0

Why aren't you getting into it? Do you want to? Do you have questions? Let's chat, let's compare notes, let's help each other.","Agile methodology is a component of DevOps in that you switch to better habits of having staged environments that you promote changes through. Dev/Testing/Prod, which is time consuming to do without Agile methodology and related automation (CI/CD pipelines) in the traditional sense, but is trivial to actually execute day to day when you have the relevant automations.

Change management is not relevant in a fully realised DevOps ecosystem, not because you stop caring about it, but because the way change management formally works does not work in DevOps ecosystems, and the risk justifying Change management in the first place is mitigated. It is mitigated by having version controls of the IaC aspects, for example (commits/merges for code in repos, being able to roll back code, diff changes of databases automatically managed, etc). So in environments like that having change management, where you meet once a week to review all the changes and have them justified and approved, is a massive hamstring. When you can instead have daily scrums, do merge requests that require approval from peers that get processed within minutes/hours.

There are plenty of orgs that have pursued the ""digital transformation"" of transforming how they operate into DevOps (to say in short-parlance), but they either did it poorly or in an incomplete fashion. These issues can derive from many different regards, such as management/executive unwilling to give up the control that change management gave them prior, such as improperly configuring CI/CD pipelines, insufficiently educating/training staff on what this is going to look like and how to be successful in ""the new world"" so to say. There are plenty of examples of really incomplete/poor implementations of DevOps, but there are a steady supply of very successful DevOps transitions.

When the DevOps Engineer chats with the Data Scientist.","It's a rabbit hole haha, the easiest answer is ""work for a client,"" you'll learn whether you like it or not.

A more practical and accessible answer is probably to try and deploy something for yourself, to get there you'll need to learn all about infrastructure.

I'm web developer by trade, so this isn't the only way to ""deploy"" software- Deployment is any act which gets it into the intended users' hands. So deployment could also mean distributing a Windows installer or releasing a game on Steam.

But, for web deployments, if you want to learn, start by getting the application up and running on your computer, obviously. So you should have one or more HTTP servers running at different ports, i.e. frontend on localhost:3000, backend on localhost:4000, etc.

Then grab a free tier account such as on AWS or Heroku, and start jumping through all the hoops necessary to get your app running in a hosted environment. You'll end up learning about VMs, hosted containers, possibly Kubernetes, domain names and DNS, proxies, the works. All of these things are largely necessary for cloud hosting.

You can also go a little simpler by grabbing a raspberry pi and trying to use that as a webserver via a combination of port forwarding and DNS configuration. But that's the less industry-relevant route, though just as fun.",-1,0.0

+1 on blameless postmortems. We call them 'retrospectives' here and they go really far into getting people to share the actual truth of what happened, and provide their thoughts on options moving forward. We document them in a wiki for later searching/reference - no names attached to ""who"" caused a problem. Just what happened.

We also try to avoid HPPO (hippos) which are the ""Highest Paid Person's Opinion"" so that everyone gains a sense of ownership and inclusion on almost every project.

Some of this depends on the style of project management you go with. We do ""agile"" here but try not to be too dogmatic about it. We do sprints, but don't really do velocities, but we do daily standups, sprint planning as a group, and sprint retrospectives. We use a kanban board to help keep everyone's tasks/workload visible.

It works for us but might not really follow Agile/Scrum to the letter, and that's fine with us.

We also block off an hour every  other week for everyone to show code to the group. This is for review purposes, crowdsourcing a tough problem, education, reducing ""bus factor"", and simple team-bonding. Someone always brings a snack, and we can review anything from a fresh piece of documentation, a merge request, a really nifty little function or method, or even infrastructure or architecture. Really rather rewarding. Last time we did one of these I brought a bunch of padlocks and a lockbox to let the group work through a simple ""encryption"" problem in the real world.

Just some stuff that works for us, we also make sure to invite the IT folks (and other stakeholders!) to anything we're doing that's relevant even though we have a dedicated ""DevOps"" guy (me).",-1,0.0

Sorry to hear you're feeling burnt out/negative about the environments at the moment.

A lot of this feels like a company culture issue, companies who don't really know what they're doing tend to jump on bandwagons and the 'latest shiny thing' blindly. I would argue this creates more issues than the new tool usually solves. As you note you have a multitude of different tools within your ecosystem and the use of different tools is actually causing friction rather than efficiency.

For example, we use the Gitlab ecosystem extensively, for code repositories, pipelines etc. There are always new tools/techniques for deployments (we use CDK and Terraform extensively deployed using our own custom frameworks for Gitlab CI).

When we find a new tool/technique we create a spike, someone will find a quiet Friday afternoon to write up some POC code and present to the Platform team.   
  
What is key here is that the presentation and critique is against the tool, not the individual. I think this keeps people keen to try new things without a poor tool reflecting poorly on them as an engineer.  
  
Coming to the meeting with 'We saw tool X gaining traction, I tried tool X and to be honest I thought it was a pile of ****, here's why:' is a perfectly valid answer as long as you have sufficient evidence to back up your argument.

I think this helps strike the balance between constantly shifting to new (possibly inferior) technology and a stagnated stack that becomes stale and difficult to work with.

I don't mean to be rude by directly quoting you here:

>IaC is great until Terraform state breaks and you’re in ****. GitOps is cool until you realize drift is inevitable. 

Terraform state doesn't just break in my experience, either someone is changing resources outside of the IAC or the IAC is poorly written and thus always sees 'changes'.  
  
I will say there have been bugs in the past with certain providers so Terraform is as good as its provider in that sense.

Cloudformation (in my opinion) is inferior, yep its lovely that I can write my IAC in Typescript the same language I'm writing my source code in, but the whole ecosystem feels a bit **** in comparison to Terraform. Reconciling resource drift being a large factor here.

I think time needs to be spent firstly asking 'Why?'.   
  
Why is resource drift occurring?  
  
Are the pipelines so brittle that people rather make the changes in the console?  
  
Is this an effort to circumvent security checks?  
  
Why are the tools not standardised, of-course we should POC new tools but why are tools being introduced seemingly randomly to fix issues?

Once this is identified work can begin restoring faith into your CI/CD process fixing the identified issues.

The burnout and on-call situation is a kiss of death. Engineers who are burnt out do not find proper fixes, they duct tape and move on. This causes more on-call issues to deal with and additional burnout. There needs to be a reset here.",-1,0.0

I would tend to agree with you on devops tooling. I think that what holds Windows back in that regard is the registry, basically.

You get a rock star in that sells everyone on a new thing and makes it sing. They leave, nobody else knows how to do it. That thing just becomes something that's paid for.


I did analytics for years and saw the same. One dept uses powerbi,,another tableau, another excel, another python...subdivided groups wo a unified bi dept. Someone leaves, others have to figure out how to support the already built stuff wo wasting money rewriting it all bc management gets **** if anything looks or works differently and doesn't want to give up the sunk cost.


You got the rock star that builds a resume builder proekect then leaves the company. You got other folks that want to optimize and prine things but mgmt wont foot the bill on something that won't make money..and the tech folks have a hard time explaining how ditching licenses and optimizing code will provide cost avoidance and cost savings down the road. Lot of projects get 80% done and considered ""good enoigh"" that mgmt moves devs to other stuff leaving end users constantly wasting time (money) manually working around issues in system that a one time cost could fix.


So a lot of this comes down to selling mgmt on the idea of going the extra mile,,paying for tech debt to clean up and optimize, but a lot of folks are burned out and feel it's a sysiohean task trying to make that happen.


Doesn't help that every year some new software comes out promising to solve all the problems, and mgmt or devops think it will,,and it's just another thing that has to get supported in the future.


Another thing is mgmt not understanding agile. Devs roll something out in phases, but need,that cleanup and optimization phase, and also a phase to reassess how everything at the company works together to rebuild stuff to be more seemless. That's a hard sell to mgmt.


Company I'm at put a freeze on all projects until a massive data lake could get done to coordinate all data at the company and make it much eaiser for all systems to tap a single data lakw w abstract data profile layers instead of every system having their own solution. I've worked at some big companies that would never spend a dime on such a thing even when devs, ****, ba's, etc showed valie cost benefit. They just want the devs to keep pushing forward with new stuff. ""New = profit ... Revise = expense"". 


So yeah..lot of problems, but it mostly stems from bus management. Management owns the company, processes, procedures. Devops can't magically do better if mgmt is not on board with the ideas.",8,0.9546705600360366

This is exactly what’s going to happen with a project I’m working on. We’ve recently been moved under a new director as part of a recent acquisition who has forced certain code patterns and delivery requirements on us for certain IaC projects.  

What used to be a simple self-service workflow that was “check your iac module into this repo, pipeline will kick off and do basic linking and formatting, if it passes and when you’re ready to apply to prod, open an MR, we’ll take it from there” is now “check code in to these three separate repos, source your modules from a fourth repo, kick off three separate pipelines and do all of your plan and apply operations via GitHub comments”.  

Four repos. Three pipelines. Just to (in one example) add a single widget to a datadog dashboard.

The most they would do is write a throwaway script, or possibly have their own personal set of scripts. But write an actual tool for broader consumption? Never.It's one of the biggest differences I see day to day in enterprise operations and developer mindsets.

Operations teams on the other hand want to find an off the shelf tool, with enterprise support, even for what could be a fairly simple task.",-1,0.0

Let's take a moment to feel the pain of their devops team","Thankfully, it isn't run like that. There's a fairly clear incident management process where different people take on roles (incident commander, communications, operations lead etc. -- for small incidents this might be one person, for big ones these are all different people) -- the communications lead's job is to shield everyone working on the incident from that kind of micromanagement. You can read about it in [the SRE book, chapter 14](https://sre.google/sre-book/managing-incidents/).

The only incident I've ever been a part of where my VP wanted to hear details during the incident itself was a very long, slow-burning issue where we were at serious risk of an outage recurring, even then they just wanted to be in the loop and ask a few questions. I'm sure it's not like that everywhere, but at least in my experience it's been very calm and professional.

The time to examine everything in details comes _after_ the incident, to figure out why it happened, and how to prevent it in the future. This follows a [blameless postmortem process](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/). You might be like ""psh, yeah right"", but for the most part it's true. Not all postmortems are quality (some do lowkey point fingers at other teams) or have poor takeaways, but all the big issues ultimately end up creating work to make the system/process/etc. more robust.

* To configure Jenkins images, we have to work with another team to do it. GH Actions feels more self-service

We help companies move their infrastructure to an off premises solution.  A lot of companies we work with have these large cobbled together networks.  Networks that are the result of years of mergers, divestitures, legacy systems that are expensive to replace, different management ideas, lazy administrators, the list goes on.  In an effort to get their IT costs under control these companies turn to the latest buzzword in IT 'devops'.  What happens after a few years is they have a bunch of admins and developers with new titles basically doing the same work they've always did.  To fast forward through all the lib lob after we get done most of their on-site infrastructure is gone, the data centers are gone, the huge complex AD structure is gone, most applications are hosted, databases instances are cut significantly, the the IT workforce cut by at least 75%.

The reality is a company truly following the devops philosophy doesn't need administrators (hence dev and ops not dev admin ops).  There is no need for a team of high paid admins to manage on-site hardware, then another team to manage the applications on that hardware.  Then another team for facilities to mange the data centers.  The hardware is hosted by a cloud provider, the application is in a pipeline or hosted by a 3PP

&#x200B;

One issue that comes to my mind is that, if a DevOps workflow is set up properly, you can hire labor from anywhere for app development even if the deployment is within a protected network (e.g. SOC-2 / HIPAA). Compliance plans specify procedures for vetting app dependencies - and there's no difference between a feature PR and pulling in a third-party dependency in principal (given the feature PR may have some additional constraints imposed, in line with the same constraints for any other external dependency).

Infrastructure work in a protected network is going to require a U.S.-based developer who has been vetted. Those vetting requirements can be stiff, as well: clean background check, no instances of fired for cause, good credit report, etc.

I'm in the process of shifting to platform engineering / DevOps work. It's challenging and I enjoy the mental stimulation. I spent ten years in networking / sysadmin (partly in a F100 environment) and then ten years as a developer (mobile / web app / middleware). I've decided I will not work with protected networks after spending time in a devops/platform role (my first) for a company that has that constraint. I want to live as a digital nomad, planting my flag where I choose but retaining a U.S. presence (my incorporated freelance business). I could not do this in the role I just mentioned. Our hiring base for additional talent to augment the team was also seriously restricted. We had several good developers we could have brought in, but because they were based in Africa, or Europe, or China, it was a no-go.

I still haven't figured out how to move into the field fully given that constraint (no SOC / HIPAA work) and would appreciate any suggestions anyone has.",0,1.0

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spoken with Directors, VPs, CIOs, CDOs, CTOs, CISOs that just don’t understand the concept that there’s more outside of AWS/Azure/GCP.

According to a study by IBM, some of the most common challenges include environment provisioning, manual testing, no DevOps center of excellence, test data, manual deployments, planning in a DevOps environment, DevOps and suppliers, DevOps and governance, no integrated tools architecture, manual releases, no DevOps metrics, DevOps and team composition, DevOps and regulatory compliance, no service virtualization, DevOps and specialist skills, traceability across the DevOps landscape, large releases, inconsistent environments, agile confined to developers, limited transparency, manual processes, collaboration between development and operations, no DevOps vision or strategy, no production-like environments, waste in existing processes, limited customer feedback, elicitation of nonfunctional requirements, and collaboration across all IT disciplines .
To mitigate these challenges, organizations can take several steps, such as automating manual processes, using integrated tools, establishing a DevOps center of excellence, implementing agile methodologies, providing training and support for DevOps teams, and fostering a culture of collaboration and communication between development and operations teams .

I am thankful I remember much more simple times, when apps were tiny, run on regular computers in my office, and you could symply restore from a local backup to bring a service back online.Now we have companies paying thousands of dollars a month to host a simple site or web app, because now it's all in the cloud, no matter the apps function, while hosting customers assume about 80-90 percent of responsibility for securing and maintaining their app anyway. Containerization is leveraged to add a ""backdoor"" for individual admins, but that only serves to protect infrastructure, it actually makes a customer's individual app open to vulnerability that same as running your own instance if you miss vital updates or if there is a breakdown in the supply chain. We need to stop listening to the companies that market tools and be honest with ourselves... Security needs a better model than just adding new tools and entry points to the app chain.There's gotta be a point where you evaluate things and tell yourself that there has to be a better and more affordable way than tunneling through 5 VPNs just to push updates for 8 disparate JS and PHP libraries and 5 containers. App and library updates are also far too frequent in 2023 as well... Frameworks need to ship instances with less features, and modules should be reduced to only those used and deemed most essential, reducing footprint is a key aspect lost on technological advancement, it is also a firm indicator of increased efficiency for app and library devs if you ask me.Now with zero trust, devs literally spend a lot of their daily workload logging back in and re-establishing VPN connections due to timeouts. There's got to be a point where we develop a far more simple IT solution to all of this mess. Security is still getting compromised regularly no matter what is done. The solution also won't likely involve Ai at this point in my opinion, as security and complexity are assuredly not resolved by leveraging current-state Ai tools.It's also important to note this is why PHP is still going strong, it doesn't require compilation, and is relatively easier than most other langs on learning curve to implement.I literally built my IT career on making things simpler, and in explaining complex IT issues in human language to non-technical people. There is a lot of room in my field for growth due to the rest of the industry's constant focus on jargon and over-complexity.Simpler solutions, conveyed and implemented in human language, will be king in 2024.",12,0.6497649860163496

3. kelsey hightower is not bungling anything. it's just as simple as that, and coincidentally the same thing i've been telling you.

gitops just means defining your infrastructure in your vcs and ideally instantly applying it to the system, it has absolutely nothing to do with pushing vs pulling anything.

ci/cd does not colloquially refer to anything that has to do with a vcs. where i work we have plenty of ci/cd systems that don't use a vcs. jenkins is a popular choice for this kind of setup. you can trigger a ci/cd pipeline through other means, such as pushing a container to a repository, or through webhooks, a jar file entering a file server, or whatever you can think up, even triggering pipelines when something happens in a central git repo.

gitops specifically and only means declarative IaC in a git repo, which triggers ci/cd pipelines. it means you shouldn't trigger any ci/cd without having it declared in git first, otherwise git is no longer the single source of truth.",3,0.4335364788034193

- Check for documentation(I'm sure is outdated or null), and prioritize what is critical for business continuity.

- Teach to your devs the [git basic workflow!](https://codingbone.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/git-basicwf1.png), you can achieve a lot with these simple steps.

- Check deployment scripts. At least for me it's better to have a configuration management + git to document architectural changes.

- Do an audit around physical assets to identify equipments for decommission.

- Some kind of project management workflow. As you want to implement changes faster I suggest using Kanban or some agile methodology. 

- Involve your team in your plan, you are nothing without them. 

- If they've been writing tests, use jenkins. Otherwise, ask for software testing. 

- Facilitate your developers a way to create working environments without a hassle. You can check vagrant, docker or lxd. 

- Encourage knowledge sharing between the team. If your team haven't improved their skills it's because their previous technical lead didn't show interests on them.

- Finally but not last, understand exactly what management expects from your team, so you can work in line with the same objectives they have.

Seriously :-). For example, we have a system that allows us debugging remotely in production, with full Visual Studio experience.

You can do this securely. For instance, the privilege level of the dev can be elevated ""just in time"" for the session. Depending on the security level of the system, it can be done automatically, or after various levels of approvals (peer dev; manager; a set of dedicated access owners), the channel will open (only for VS remote debugging port), the debug session would happen, and the machine would be wiped and reimaged immediately afterwards.

And yes, defense in depth means that your system is hardened from the inside, rather than firewalled, because if this is not the case, when the break-in happens (when, not if), the disaster will only be worse.",-1,0.0

- you are not provoking anything with a reddit post
- as I said in another post: certification means nothing. Some are easy to obtain, most people will just learn for the exam and then forget everything. If you don't practice, you forget. Also, we tend to expeft too much from someone with certificates, even if applicants are decently good, recruiters will expect more and be deceived

For the question itself:
It's as hard to hire a good devops as to hire a good project manager. There are multiple factors.

Many people invent themselves ""devops engineer""/manager without knowing what it actually means. I worked many years as a lead developer in charge of the recruitment and enforced DevOps mentality. Issue is: people think this is all about the tools when it is not. There are just tools.

Now, when some applies, he will put ""devops engineer"", okay, why not. Then in the interview, when you ask about what devops is he will respond ""I use docker and CI"": CI is also a concept and they meant they use the Github Actions/Gitlab CI tools. For docker, they don't even know the role it plays and barely know a few commands.

On the recruitment side, many don't know better.
That's why I recently made a post about what DevOps is and isn't.

I would say: stop searching for a ""DevOps"" or ""DevOps expert"" as everyone think it's the new word for ""Developer"" or for anyone that used docker/ansible/terraform once. Instead, search for an experienced Developer and mention ""experience with product maintenance, delivery and lifecycle management"". You should then be able to filter from the motivation letter when they describe why they fit for the position. That's also how the question should be asked during an interview and not ""I see you have DevOps/Docker experience. Tell me more about it"" which misslead the applicant.",0,0.9008687055140903

Instead of dev manager, test manager we're ditching them and dividing the system in responcibles each sitting under a head of tech for delivery in a specific area. To support this we're moving to SOA so lots of small services providing restful or message queue interfaces to upstream / other teams. We're also moving from puppet managed by devops to unicorn managed by urr me.

The impact? Everything is slowing down to a halt for us. Some teams are off writing new services and letting our shared monolithic code base rot. It's becoming more fragile as there isn't the man power to overhaul the framework and move it since people have walked away from the code base without deleting their areas of functionality (because that's low priority for them). If they just deleted all their now-redundant unit tests that could save us a nice 30 minutes.

I'm oodles of time rewriting the rpm spec and init scripts to simulatanously cope with being in both the classic system and the new wizzy do it ourselves model so I can ensure at any one point we can keep the release process available.

In the meantime our project is starting to run late. We used to average 35 points per iteration but we're seeing that drop off and the truth is, with so much additonal stuff, without the time to adjust to the role and write the supporting logic..

There isn't a single golden technology that's perfect for everything.

Might wanna reach out of your bucket before saying these types of things. Not everything can be completely serverless without a cost/pitfall. There is a cost in both performance and time to develop the same / similar solution of an app to be serverless instead. Among other things there are also many non-functional requirements serverless just isn't made to support easily. If I have for example more than a handful of microservices, I have to easily be able to spin them up, keep them up, monitor them, and get logs from them. In some cases (a lot of cases) this isn't something straightforwardly done by trying to abstract a bunch of scripts together. This also then requires your developers to understand a complex web of connections between serverless apps, especially the more you have, and the more dependencies they have.

This is (one reason) everyone is aboard the kubernetes/container train. Having ported quite a few of what I'd consider ""legacy"" apps, I can say that dockerizing the app and putting it on a kubernetes cluster while difficult is much more straight forward than having to learn everything about how the app works and trying to move it into being something that's serverless. You use these technologies where they make sense, not try and fit everything to them. It's the same thing a lot of people have run into with infrastructure as code, e.g. with terraform it's very complicated to use it for databases / stateful things due to the nature of them being stateful which is requiring people to have to find other tools that fit it better.",12,0.6741778638233444

(What pipeline tools do you use?),"I think the easiest and simplest way to explain this u/Zauxst is that Jenkins file format and DSL is unlike any other programming or scripting language out there.  They've invented their own unique DSL that makes it so you must ""live and breathe"" their DSL or you're absolutely useless at it.  As an DevOps architect and a trainer, I can't hand a bunch of Jenkins DSL over to an Dev team even with training and expect them to be even reasonably decent at supporting/engineering more pipelines without them taking days/weeks of training and practice to learn the format and its intricacies.

Whereas, with most modern CI/CDs, they use an common and widely accepted file format (YAML), and they basically run bash/shell/etc scripts.  Any developer with almost no experience of Gitlab CI or Circle CI could jump into an existing setup and add some tests and modify scripts with ease without spending hours/days learning an entire new unique DSL and file format specific for Jenkins.

Admittedly, the DSL of Jenkins is quite powerful, but its power is also its greatest weakness.  The readability and digestability comes at a high complexity for most folks.  As I said, you have to basically be an expert at Jenkins and their Jenkinsfile/DSL to be even remotely effective.

This high complexity-to-entry of this ends up being (imho) tech debt from day one and it ends up gating which of your engineers (if any) can support the pipelines and CI/CD.  This high complexity/debt ends up having to be supported by either your team of DevOps/Sysadmins, or which I've seen numerous times it ends up being supported in an enterprise by ""one guy whose religion is Jenkins"" which ends up being a huge SPOF when that person quits.

Jenkins does something which I as an DevOps consultant firmly stand against, which is using any technology which ""gates"" people (intentionally or unintentionally) from being able to understand, support, maintain, and use it.  Jenkins is one of those insanely over-complicated technologies, which almost any other CI/CD system out there is much more easily understood and supported by engineers at any level of seniority.",3,1.0

Why do you think hiring DevOps experts is such a challenge? Have you faced the same issue in your own experience?

Go around this sub, on the topics where new people ask for the set of skills they might need to land a job, and see how the post gets inundated with folks saying: ""*you don't need good networking or Linux foundations. You just need Kubernetes and git*"".

Yes: the pay rate is also an issue, but using it as a blanket justification is naive, and self-validating.


The market for DevOps, SRE, CloudOps, SysOps, and cloud infrastructure-related roles surged during the pandemic, leading to a shortage of qualified professionals and substantial pay offers for (technical) entry-level positions. Then the market slowed down, with the high-salary job market shrinking, and many professionals now find themselves in a precarious position with limited technical expertise.

If it's not the case, how we conciliate the difficulties of getting professionals for the roles from the HR people and the hardships of the incoming professionals to land a job?

This is generally recommended, but don't go overboard with this approach. I haven't used ADO pipelines, but after cutting my teeth on Jenkins, GitLab, and GitHub Actions, I've found that a lot of these platforms offer significant features (job parallelization, error handling, composability) that it would be foolish to try to re-implement in your scripting language of choice.

A good general rule of thumb I follow is to implement the top-level logic in the native pipeline syntax (build these two jobs at the same time, then run this third job which depends on the last two being successful, then always run this cleanup job no matter what), while the more intricate, prone-to-error stuff should be written in Groovy / Bash / Python / whatever in a way that can be tested locally - preferably with some kind of case logic to determine whether or not we're running in CI and behave accordingly.

The lack of even basic syntax checking or schema validation does indeed sound like a major oversight. But if having 47 commits in your Git log with the message ""maybe this time ci will work jk lol"" bothers you so much, you can use squash merges.",3,0.3268652657377081

however, the common definition of gitops is just using IaC in git as a single source of truth through pull request-triggered ci/cd pipelines. has nothing to do with pull or push methods, both are equally valid. the point is that you use git for defining state of the system. in contrast, each server represents the state and git is a repository for your IaC stuff (git doesn't dictate state, it just contains tools to set it). if git triggers an action or if the system polls git really doesn't make any difference.

the way you use pulumi might be gitops, but only if git is the source of truth. take my example with managing users through git. gitops means ensuring the system is as defined in the users file. non-gitops could be having a tool that adds or deletes users, but the source of truth is in config files on the server. to get a list of users, you would read the users file from the server. this way of managing stuff would make sense if you tie user creation to for example an application. lets say you deploy application ""a"" that creates a postgres user ""alice"". next you deploy application ""b"" that creates a postgres user ""bob"". to get the list of users, you would check the postgres database. it's the norm in my experience.

so, gitops just means that you have the truth about any given state defined in git, rather than on the individual servers. no relation to push/pull methods.",3,0.4335364788034193

I think there's a cognitive bias involved that leads intelligent people to the conclusion you state (""*every human being on this earth has the ability to learn a skill no matter how big or small*""). I don't have any vested interest in the answer, and my preference would be that the answer is as you suggest.

I've had one experience on that topic that's stuck with me. In my early 20s, I attended a twelve-step group for a few years. It was convenient to attend the same meeting once a week and most of the attendees were regulars. Almost everyone in the group more or less fit the profile of posters here: college-educated (or equivalent) professionals who had a passion or two in life and intellectual curiosity. I became really good friends with people in this group over an extended period of time. We all went out to dinner afterwards and our spouses/SOs socialized together as well.

I try not to judge people, and I think I've achieved that in my life for the most part. I've never thought too much of myself to do menial jobs - construction and a commercial laundry during university, things like that. I've always liked the people I work around unless they go out of their way to prevent that.

One of the people in the group was slower than the rest and worked at a fast food restaurant cleaning in the kitchen. I learned at one point from him that he tested in the mid-70s for IQ. Someone at that level of intelligence is completely in the normal range - it's not due to a condition like trisomy-21, just a normal intelligence in the spectrum. There's as many people with an IQ of 75 as there are at 125; I personally just am not as aware of them due to my social circumstances, aptitude, etc. I'll refer to this person as ""J"".

""J"" had absolutely no intellectual curiosity, about anything. We spent a lot of time giving advice to each other; someone has some problem crop up during the week, asks for help, others chip in. There was a lot of genuine concern for each other. ""J"" just completely failed to ""connect the dots"" on things in his life - why other people behaved in certain ways, what the predictable reaction to some action of his would be, things like that. His extended family was the same as he was as far as mental acuity (I met got to know a few of them a bit when they joined us for dinner afterwards, and from him talking about them).

After I had known ""J"" for a couple of years, he decided he wanted to move up to the front line at his fast food restaurant. He had set goals and slowly progressed career wise; moving from cleaning to running the frying station was a long (six month) process and not entirely successful. But moving up to running a cash register was just completely beyond his ability, despite a supportive manager, the help of our group, and a strong motivation to achieve it.

He could manage the basics of the position - pushing the correct button with the correct picture based on what someone ordered. But he never could, for example, competently change someone's order if they decided they wanted something else - especially if they were indecisive and did it more than once. He couldn't handle and would become very confused if someone wanted something special where he had to communicate the change to the line cook during a busy lunch or dinner rush. They had very various metrics an employee had to meet to keep that job (order accuracy, register money balancing at the end of a shift, number of complaints, etc.) and he was just miles away from achieving even the minimum, even with months of training and special help.

I've always kept in mind how lucky I am to end up where I did on that cognitive spread. I did nothing to deserve it. But there are lots of normal people in society who are cognitively incapable of doing tasks that we probably take entirely for granted.

Your point on fit is probably well taken. I've worked in some very toxic environments and for various reasons lacked the ability to leave at the time. I've also worked in great places (like my last job).",-1,0.0

I see. Would you also write more code if you didn't have to test it? Just check it in - you'd be very efficient. Let someone else fix your bugs/build breaks.

>  Also, not all code in microsoft were well written and easily maintained.

And that's where DevOps shines. You write **** - YOU die maintaining it, rather than wasting company's money on hiring manual laborers to do it for you. Don't like it? Either fix it, or get out. Can't recommend Google or Amazon to you, it's the same there (Amazon is worse) - but try Apple. I've heard it's a fantastic place to work :-).

> I don't know any Dev in microsoft that loves NoOp. Dev Manager, who never get on support call at night, all seems love it. 

This just means you don't know many devs. I work on Autopilot, look it up. On our team, the rotation was until very recently was ONLY done by managers - dev managers, including myself, and dev leads. No one below Principal. Just recently we opened it to other senior devs and some SDE IIs - so many people wanted to join that we actually booted dev managers to free up some space. Still, I do about half of deployments myself.

You know why other devs wanted in? Doing oncall allows people understand deeply how software runs outside their immediate areas. I actually love doing oncall, I asked to keep myself on rotation, but they kicked me off anyway.

Here are some steps organizations can take to adopt DevOps practices:
Assess your current situation: Before you start the transition, it is important to understand your current processes, tools, and culture. Identify bottlenecks, pain points, and areas for improvement.
Start with small pilot projects: Start with a small team or a pilot project to test the waters and experiment with DevOps practices. This can help you identify what works and what doesn't work in your organization.
Establish a DevOps culture: DevOps culture emphasizes collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement. Encourage cross-functional teams to work together and create a safe environment where people are empowered to experiment and fail.
Automate everything: Automation is a critical component of DevOps. Automate as many tasks as possible, including build, test, deployment, and monitoring.
Use the right tools: Choose tools that support DevOps practices, such as version control systems, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools, and monitoring and logging tools.
Measure success: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of your DevOps practices. This can help you track progress and identify areas for improvement.
Some common challenges organizations may face during the transition to DevOps include:
Cultural resistance: Adopting DevOps practices requires a cultural shift, and some employees may resist change.
Lack of skills: DevOps requires a diverse set of skills, including software development, infrastructure management, and automation. Finding the right talent can be a challenge.
Legacy systems: Organizations with legacy systems may face challenges in integrating them with modern DevOps tools and practices.
Security and compliance: DevOps practices can sometimes conflict with security and compliance requirements, which can create challenges in regulated industries.
Silos: DevOps emphasizes cross-functional collaboration, but organizations with siloed teams may struggle to break down those barriers.",0,1.0

One particular part that is troublesome is when ops are being handed things that someone for some reasons thinks dev should not do because it's a server task, but when it's actually a development task.

For instance determining the version of JSF in a Java EE shop. This is just absolute nonsense. No ops guy has any idea of what JSF is other than that it's ""some library needed by Java"".

With such a setup developers have to beg ops to update the version of JSF, but such an update is not in the interest of ops. If power plays are in place they will just deny or stall the request indefinitely. Ops also can't judge why one version or one implementation would be better or worse than the other. In short, this task should simply not be given to them.

The way I see DevOps is that you have teams with people who are more specialized in ops, but also understand dev. They are part of the same team as dev and thus nobody has to beg anyone to do something they don't want to do. The team decides together if another version of something is needed. Maybe a team lead makes a final decision and then it just happens.",0,1.0

I'm one of a few people at my company pushing this whole ""devops"" idea.  What I care about is if a system/software is used Enterprise Wide I want it automated to high **** to ensure that the amount of **** fingers that could go into wrecking a deployment from UAT to PROD are mitigated and that everything is standardized to the nth degree to ensure uniformity of how these systems are used.

I know first hand that if you ""give"" a system to the developers without no means of control that system will go to absolute ****.  I'm currently trying to bring an extremely component at our work out of this death spiral of mis-management.

Also, DevOPs I find is less about the software and more about the ideology.  Setting standards and governance around what is used and then enforcing it.

edit - 

> Yes, this does change the Developer's responsibilities slightly.. they now care about the systems they are creating instead of the algorithms they are pumping out. That, IMO, is a good thing.

IMHO this is where the business should be driving.  Yes, I understand developers are working far too hard as it is but there's so much efficiency to be gained by giving developers direct access to their isolated components of the system.  The issue then becomes my above point to standards, governance and enforcing those ideals.",0,0.9585677101232083

We're spending way too much money on datadog, so management is looking into self hosted solutions.

There are plenty of places that do it well. Most problems extend from a lack of discipline and informed top-down culture. 

The most common causes of failed implementation and stress were in companies that allowed their business units to build literally anything and use any solution to get their results. Which is how they ended up with multiple clouds, lack of implemented reference architecture, etc. When trying to introduce devops standards after the fact, they have 50 different solutions to account for and are unable to establish any form of contract for automation. This results in tears and frustration.

Places where it works are ones that say from the start, or early enough in the process, what the established tools are. They provide reference architecture and a standard of doing things. Anything that is a deviation is documented and accounted for at the time of creation. 

However, this requires proper enforcement through things like IAM and policy. All of which must also be backed by management that is more concerned with doing things well than doing things ""faster""

In my opinion this is where well written CI/CD frameworks and repository templates come in.

The CI/CD frameworks should be robust enough to deal with a multitude of different deployment types/resources but also friendly for the end users creating repositories.

Paired with repository templates, the user can create a repo from a template, fill out a handful of variables to indicate where their IAC / source code is in the repository in the gitlab-ci.yml file and they are done.

All of the jobs to propagate should be decided initially at the framework level, if an end user wishes to change the default behaviour they can do with either a predefined toggle variable or extending from the framework. The former is preferable in my opinion as this is more closely reproduceable.

Research renovate - this is a tool to help keep dependencies up to date and greatly reduced a lot of our workload maintaining repos. It will create an MR to update some repositories dependencies, all of the tests run in the MR pipeline giving confidence that its not going to break anything.

A good organisation (in my opinion) uses a shared responsibility model.

Generally speaking I write the majority of CI/CD frameworks for the devs and they just 'plug it in'.  
If they wish to contribute to the frameworks they are more than welcome to raise an MR (They often do if they've found yet another node module package manager :D ).  
They are responsible for running their deployments and the surrounding source code, of-course I'll provide help if and when they need it.

Unfortunately I feel that some of the negative aspects you're speaking about are inherent in this line of work.

I don't mean this for just Platform Engineering / DevOps / Whatever new term someone with a blog coins and the industry mindlessly adopts.

This is a part of tech as a whole, practices and tools that are adopted are not always for the best.

Speak to a Web Dev and I'm sure they have some choice words about their employers use of framework, In the last 5 years alone I think I've lost count of how many new JS frameworks have come out to fix the last one, only to fall short and the whole thing continues again.",24,1.0

The big one is that there is a lot of crappy code out there, and as a hugely popular framework in the enterprise world, that means there's a lot of crappy enterprise Spring code. People get exposed to it a couple times and their takeaway is that Spring (and Java) are the _reason_ for the crappiness.

Related to that, Spring has evolved over time like any other framework. Old crappy Spring code is less likely to be using modern idioms.

And third, a lot of people are unwilling to spend time learning how Spring works. It has tons of excellent documentation, both official and third-party, but from what I've seen over the years, probably 80-90% of devs never read the docs and instead just mimic or even copy-paste existing code without understanding why Spring is being used a certain way. And when their use case differs from the original one and that particular way of using Spring isn't appropriate, they blame Spring for being finicky.

Spring is, and always has been, fully open-source. Leaving aside the documentation, the core dependency-injection code can be fully read and understood in a matter of days by a competent Java dev (which I realize isn't always a given) and after that, a lot of the ""magic"" behavior stops feeling magical and starts feeling logical and predictable.",-1,0.0

Pushing is not GitOps, take it from the people who coined the term (see my previous link). I'd even argue that IaC necessary includes the ""use git + CI/CD pipelines"" because otherwise, you just have declarative deploy scripts, but the act of manually running them makes the overall equation procedural, not declarative. GitOps is properly defined in contrast to traditional IaC as I just defined it, not yolo'ing procedural deploy scripts.",3,0.4335364788034193

* Product manager
* Data engineer / DBA
* Sales rep

Software engineers usually think of environments as a place that a certain revision of code is running. 

QA might think of it where they test a specific release.

My personal favourite setup is dev teams focused on creating and operating the service, then a skilled central ops team who just ensures that nothing **** is being done and helps educate. A bit like how good security is instilled into teams.",0,1.0

Let me give you an example of when tests made a difference. I was working on a piece of the system that I only knew a little bit about, but had a good set of unit tests and a handful of integration tests against an in-memory database. I wrote a failing test, changed the code to make the test pass, and noticed that another test failed.

It turned out that the code was (inexplicably) used in another module. I'm pro code-reuse, but it was in the wrong area. So, I created a new class, added the appropriate unit tests, and updated the code in both areas to use the new class. The code was cleaner than before, and I knew that before I called it done, I had to manually test a second unrelated area just in case.

Not all DevOps Engineers/whatevers will ALWAYS be working with tools such as K8s. Integration of legacy systems is common, along with legacy virtualization that isn't containerized. The point is, being able to debug at each abstraction layer is ridiculously undervalued by the people who hire based on buzzwords.

Computer knowledge is a long tail. A very, very long tail. The more base foundational knowledge one has when it comes to systems/networking/applications/etc, the greater their capability to diagnose and solve problems further down the virtualization stack (closer to bare-metal - yes, it matters when you're expected to fix whatever comes your way and you're not siloed into an IT fiefdom). Additionally, having expansive foundational knowledge (IMHO) facilitates a faster learning and uptake process when having to learn new technologies or services. Drop any seasoned 'systems admin' into a K8s environment and they'll instantly recognize that K8s is simply another layer of virtualization with fancier bells and whistles that facilitate self-healing and redundancy out-of-the-box, but minus the physical wiring.",6,1.0

At one large org I worked for, we compromised by insisting on certain quality standards before a metric or alarm got added to the global SRE pager escalation.  Any alerts had to be actually actionable (not just ""page our team OnCall if it's real""), come with a standardized run book, so on and so forth.  Otherwise, if teams wanted to totally own their own product, or it was very narrow or non customer facing (Finance, BI), they were responsible for their own escalation chain and support.

In the case of any site outages, the global ops / SRE team handled the incident management and coordination, so we were responsible for evaluating where in the stack the issue was and spinning up a Slack channel with the right product stakeholders in it to drive the solution.

This required the global ops / SRE team to at least be familiar with everything in the environment in a way that just having a bunch of embedded SREs can't really do alone. The central Ops team were the ones with their hands on the CDN to move traffic between datacenters, so it's very helpful to have one team that makes that call to declare an outage and move traffic.

The Incident Management team had a couple guys who were not the strongest technically, but had a deep understanding of the tech stack.  One guy's job was really that he knew where all the subject matter experts physically sat in the building, and would go physically fetch the right person to be present for emergency huddles.

Devops is about having a tighter feedback loop between operations and development (and qa, and the rest).

in the old days, developers wrote some code for a platform, and ops was expect to run it, and they were always butting heads.

If you integrate the two - where the entire platform is part and parcel of the product, and the two teams recognize each other, things tend to work much better.

I'd rather have my developers working with me to make sure the things we need to know are monitored and that everything works the way it should rather than, you know, having them point fingers at me when it breaks.

You make dev have a stake when things break, and you make ops have a stake in ensuring everything is run properly through QA, etc.

&#x200B;

>The companies building “DevOps” teams are going in the right direction, but they need to be moving away from infrastructure configuration management and towards platform engineering and enabling developer self-service.

The ultimate goal of DevOps is Self Service that fulfills every need of the teams involved in the Software Delivery process. In other words, empowers your software delivery teams to provision resources as and when they need it, without any wait or delay.

* If I can use  a self service portal/tools that auto-magically creates a service account, that fulfills my needs as well as complies with security requirements, then I am doing DevOps.
* If I can use  a self service portal/tools that auto-magically provisions Infrastructure including applicable security for my application, and deploys the version of my choice, then I am doing DevOps.
* If I can use a portal/Project Management tool to view the current status of my requirement in the Software Delivery lifecycle, then I am doing DevOps.

DevOps is a strategy whereby a team is responsible for both developing (Dev) its software, and managing its day-to-day deployment and operations (Ops). This makes software delivery faster and more reliable.

If someone's speaking of a ""DevOps"" team that receives code from everyone and deploys it on their behalf, they're talking about an Operations team, with a modern-looking name but without modern software practices.

If the team is instead managing common infrastructure, a common software platform, or something similar for the benefit of other teams, then that's probably an Infrastructure or Platform team (surprise!), which may be practising DevOps if it's creating and deploying software, but that doesn't make it ""the"" DevOps team.",0,1.0

Imma try and answer these questions.

>how networking / routing works

I think I have a halfway decent understanding.  I did just setup a openwrt router with 10 VLANs, and a managed switch.  Set up a trunk to my main PC, so I can test and switch Vlans as I see fit.  Can't say I'm a expert.  But I know you need a proper dhcp server to dish out IPs or use static IPS.  You need to set the proper subject mask based on how many IPS you need, and you need to allow traffic through the firewall.



>what common ports are

53 DNS, 67 DHCP, 80 http, 443 https, those are the most common I think.

>how to diagnose a slow Linux machine 

Well check the processes.  What is causing the machine to run slowly?  Always the first step.  From there address what that issue may be, a program?  Lack of ram?  Failing storage drive?  I'd launch a process manager, do t know the cli command off the top of my head, but googles free.


>how to check running processes

Don't know the command off the top of my head.

>what happens when you send a request to Google.com

Well first you go to the DNS server to find the IP.  Than you get routed to Google's IP address, with a SSL handshake, they SSL match, you are good to go.

>the difference between a stateless and stateful firewall 

Ooo, just learned and forgot this in my AWS course.  Imma try though.  Stateful store data and use it going forward, while the stateless split are, with no knowledge of the past.  I imagine in a firewall this means the firewall remembers the traffic it's blocking and not blocking, or if it treats the user/client as if it's the first time everytime.

>how a web server works under the hood 

Not 100% on this.   I've set up reverse proxies, and can launch a site in 2.5 seconds.   But how the actual web server works can't say.   I can say that you need to choose either http or https.  If https, you need to setup a Let's Encrypt automation process, to gain a SSL cert.  This can be done by either tls or DNS checks, with the LE bot placing a file on your server, or setting a temp Domain to verify the SSL.  From there, you need to ensure the domain provider has the public IP, potentially setup a ddns, enable the proper port forwarding.  

>how to check disk space / free mem on a Linux machine (?!?!???)

lsblk, df -h, du-h (path).  Well, first you'll need to know the memory hogging processes, like I said don't know it off hand, but than you can just type **** PID.

>how DNS works (?!?!?!?)

It's just mapping domains to IPs.  It sends out a request, which is first checked at the cache level, than goes out to the DNS server, there's some chatting back and fourth (not 100% on the exact steps), but then it comes back with the proper mapping.

>the different record types and their purpose

I don't know what this means, I'd love info on it.

>how terraform works

Can't say I know how it works exactly.  I know it's infrastructure as code.  I know it's great for setting up base systems, but not so much at configuring the systems beyond that.   I know it's often used with ansible, and when used properly, you can deploy hundreds of the same machine over and over.",20,1.0

JSON³ is starting to get some traction as an alternative which is handy because being more modern it is more rigidly designed compared to the mess that CSV is due to decades of implementations being slapped together in an it'll-do-until-it-doesn't manner.[3] Don't expect structured data though: the clients & 3rd parties I deal with are sending the same simple table format data, with multiple files for us to join together later when there is more complex structure, that they would send as CSV, just using the more bloated format⁵ for the gain in reduced encoding confusions.[4] not quoting values containing the separator character or otherwise escaping it, not dealing with existing quotes when values do get quoted, etc. - if you'd be surprised to find CSV is far from a solved problem today, then prepare to be very surprised![5] Don't get me wrong when I mention the format bloat: this _is_ a good trade for easing the other issues.

While it's true that promotions can create all sorts of incorrect incentives, the reason why AWS oncall can be brutal on some teams isn't because of promotion-orientated architectures that disregard operational load.The reason is that the company prioritizes moving fast and shipping stuff to customers. We have a deep backlog of customer asks and we want to ship them quickly. The systems need to be secure, durable, available, and fast - those are non-negotiable. But do they need to be operated automatically? Well, no, that's the easiest thing to compromise - ship quickly, have initially **** oncall, improve operations behind the scenes.This is usually why customers are always confused/concerned why AWS ships something new then releases no updates for a year. We don't compromise on security or durability, but we do compromise on engineer happiness during oncall for the first release. So after shipping, the immediate next step is to start improving automation and operations.This is done with open eyes, and most engineers are happy with it to ship things big things quicker, rather than releasing a new version of chat software every year.None of this is promotion-orientated. It's working backwards from customers.",23,1.0

Owning the entire stack and process is not something that is (or should be) done by one role. Devs shouldn't own the infra, they should understand it. Just as much that infra engineer shouldn't own everything but needs to understand what the infra is for. The owning is done by all the roles collaborating. In teams and across teams. Aka devops.

Perhaps in a small <5 engineer startup we can have a couple of devs who find themselves doing infra. Bc they have to. As soon as they grow, they'll expand their team with the relevant expertise.

Been there done that, I did application development, set up pgsql, some productivity engineering like teaching the others about git, delivery and delivery pipeline, install and manage the servers (iron), later on move everything to cloud, logging, monitoring, customer support, 3 of us owning **** everything bc we had to. First thing, looking at the expertise between the 3 of us, we got ourselves someone to manage ops and infra. The next expertise that we lacked was ux.

I'm now in a ~500 engineers company and we have a team managing infra, a platform team that turns that infra (k8s) into something the application teams can use (like managing helm and argocd), and an enabling team with a deep understanding of build and delivery pipelines. Application teams own everything because they are not devs, they are devops. Dev, qa, ops collaborating.

These teams aiding the application teams are not devops engineers. They are all those separate roles (also including dev and qa), working together, combining their expertise. 

This is OP's problem in a nutshell. Bc **** is a devops engineer. The company needs to know which expertise is needed exactly in their specific context",-1,0.0

In fact it's an idea that's well known to partly overlap with concerns of an SRE. Both deal with concerns of managing technology operations.

A good rule I learned ""pronouns mark your silo boundaries"" which is a fancy way of saying ""avoid having a 'them and us' situation.""

My point is that you should absolutely have specialists in solution architecture, writing tests, writing code, writing integration pipelines, ensuring security and supporting operations. 10x full-stack developers are perfect for your one-team startup, but they don't scale and nobody could afford a whole building full of them anyway.

But what you should strive to do is, for the purpose of delivery, keep all of those people together in a functional team, and make sure everyone in that team is jointly responsible for the whole product or feature from architecture to running in prod.

Now in a large organisation where you might have dozens of people with those specialisms, it makes sense from a career development and person management point of view to group them together, and that's fine. But don't make the mistake of turning those groups into your delivery teams, because they you're in silo land and your SDLC is going to grind to a halt.

More throwing things over the wall and having it be someone else's problem.  That's fundamentally the antithesis of DevOps.People do not fix the pain they don't see, and managers doubly so.  By shifting operations off to a ""devops"" team, you just end up with developer teams that don't know about, and don't care to fix, the things that make it painful to deploy or run their code in production.
Those that have to deal with the pain rarely have any political leverage they need to even enact change.  There's zero motivation for either the developers writing the software _or their management_ to fix it.  Dev manager incentives are purely aligned with getting code and features built.To give a nice real world example, building out new regions for AWS services used to be a pain in the **** (since I left I hear some major top down initiatives have fixed that).
The service team I worked for, almost doubly so painful for region build.  Standing up an entire region was something like ~50 days of engineering time.  Not because it was especially hard, per se, but because the ops team always had to wade through piles of refactored **** that introduced new circular dependencies, or wasn't documented, or broke other aspects of any automation we could produce. (I remember one DynamoDB schema overhaul, where we did a complicated migration.  Next region build, service components wouldn't stand up because we'd used the automation to create the new table schemas that had replaced the old table schema entries, but the service code still expected to see the old schemas in the right format.  It took several months to get the dev manager to agree to engineers spending time cleaning up old schema references from their code base.)The dev manager incentives were not aligned with making it easy.  It wasn't their engineering resources being consumed, and they had features they needed to ship.  
The developers never changed the way they worked because even though they were told the issues (and even though they were, virtually to a person, great people to work with, considerate etc.), they never experienced the pain so they never thought about  those consequences of what they were doing when they were doing it.Ops manager never had any leverage, because every single time we managed to get a region launched in time as to not be an issue, and every time things were down to the wire it was clearly as a result of the ops team not building the right automation :eyeroll:, rather than that the dev teams were making some kind of brand new nightmare each time.It wasn't until the ops team had lost enough members of staff to that BS, and region build shifted on to the developers themselves, that suddenly most of the problems went away, never to appear again.  They were aware and conscious of the pain certain decisions would cause because they had felt it themselves, and they made sure not to  introduce more pain.DevOps is about making sure incentives and politics align to make things overall better.  Shoving it in to a silo is literally the complete opposite.",0,1.0

I think a lot of issues come down to the age-old problem of product managers not knowing what they want or how they want it to work. This has been a problem since we first started writing software. We aren't good at writing clear requirements.  
  
Agile, in my opinion, should be a simple set of long term goals ""build this feature in this application to address this business/customer need"", with development using CI/CD that allows easy deployment to prod, protected by feature flags and automated testing. I don't care if it's postits on a whiteboard, or a Kanban system, but keeping it simple helps a lot.

As for specific educational resources, I don't have anything specific to recommend this moment. But I would recommend you be open to free/unpaid sources online too, depending on the circumstance.

Working as sysadmin, troubleshooter, performance improver, incident manager since then…

I never found someone in a ready to go state. 

So my personal strategy is to select only those I perceive they are curious enough to learn and improve their skills/knowledge/ experience. 

Then I mentor them. 

A lot can be achieved with 6 months of proper training and slowly increasing stress/pressure of managing whole platform/system.

I also benefited the same process myself. When I had to climb a major step in my career. 

I was the 63th candidate for a specific role of managing 200 servers for a low latency trading desk in a bank. 

I just demonstrated that I was willing to learn and make overwork for it. 

Spent the next 9 months as ghost hand of the main sysadmin, and learnt everything I could, until the point I was able to fully manage the whole platform alone and continue the r&d in performance chasing by myself. 

I was then able to contribute to global design in very positive way. 

This resulted in a 37% latency improvement, and 0 incident on the whole platform for more than a year. 

This ended abruptly when the managers were pressured to shift contracting to another company, I wasn’t in charge for next candidate interview, they selected someone I had to handover for one month before my leave.

I raised warning that the new candidate wasn’t appropriate for the job, after he challenged me when I asked him for his ssh key. « I don’t use ssh, I just use the old fashion login/password way » 

No need to say that 2 months after I quit, they had a major incident on the platform with some few millions lost.

My personal strategy is that I try to select those with the good mental state. I don’t care much about their technical skills if they demonstrate positive mental posture about learning and critical thinking. 

Of course I’m happy when I find a shining diamond, but they are rares.

There are many stone in the mud, some of them are just asking to be polished and turn in a shining gems.",-1,0.0

&#x200B;

>[GitOps uses Git repositories as a single source of truth to deliver infrastructure as code. Submitted code checks the CI process, while the CD process checks and applies requirements for things like security, infrastructure as code, or any other boundaries set for the application framework. All changes to code are tracked, making updates easy while also providing version control should a rollback be needed.](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops)

&#x200B;

>[GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications. It focuses on a developer-centric experience when operating infrastructure, by using tools developers are already familiar with, including Git and Continuous Deployment tools. The core idea of GitOps is having a Git repository that always contains declarative descriptions of the infrastructure currently desired in the production environment and an automated process to make the production environment match the described state in the repository. If you want to deploy a new application or update an existing one, you only need to update the repository - the automated process handles everything else. It’s like having cruise control for managing your applications in production. GitOps: versioned CI/CD on top of declarative infrastructure. Stop scripting and start shipping. — Kelsey Hightower](https://www.gitops.tech/)

&#x200B;

Note that they all are reputable sources and that none of them refer to a push/pull distinction. It's just declaring IaC state in git and triggering automation that makes it so.

I'll give you that push is not always as desirable as pull, but only because you might have a server that doesn't take any inbound connections, so you can't log in to push state. pulling state is also a nice way to distribute and parallelize the workload. but it makes sequencing the work much more difficult, so pull is not always desireable.",3,0.4335364788034193

This sounds like one of them. Honestly, it sounds like the developers were given the green light to just go around those pesky infrastructure people and release release release.

I'm not against the ideas that DevOps brings to the table. It's never ideal to just have the developers dump a ball of **** on your doorstep and tell you to deploy it. It's good to have your developers and your ops people on speaking terms. It's good to do small changes so you don't have to unwind a whole mess to roll back. But, I do know this:

* Large organizations are married to their management consultants, who have been gong around selling the Digital Transformation Starter Kit with different fonts and logos for years. ""Push button, get DevOps."" This is **totally** different from FAANG culture where half the world's Ph.D's are employed churning out new stuff every 2 days.
* There seems to be an absolute fetish for ""release anything that compiles, fix in production"" at some places. This is probably what you're running into. Someone read The Phoenix Project and the The DevOps Handbook and that's the lesson that came out...the production line never stops.
* IMO, DevOps is like ITIL. If you adopt it without adjusting it to fit your reality, it just becomes another mess. If you take what works it's incredibly useful. Even the small changes we've made that aren't anything like ""real"" DevOps have improved things measurably. But, our ~~weird~~ unique environment means we can't just do everything  a startup supporting a phone app can.
* One thing that has always been in the back of my mind is this...DevOps kind of requires everyone to be at the top of their game, 24/7 especially in small shops. What happens when people want a break? Crappy managers will just point to the copious amount of monitoring telemetry and guilt people into working more to keep the cadence running. This works great when you have people who don't have a life outside of work, but doesn't translate over to real life.

Problem is, now that there's a catchy buzzword and movement behind it, people who dare to question anything about DevOps are treated like heretics. I'd say give it time, but it looks like everything is going to end up abstracted away in containers anyway so there will be even more pressure to release immediately without testing. (Hint, real DevOps incorporates comprehensive testing and developers are forced to write their own tests. Microsoft fired their QA department and significantly improved code quality in Windows.)",0,1.0

Now I’m talking about platform teams that don’t act like the IT versions of how Hollywood depicts navy seals, I’m talking about day to day regular boring teams. I’ve seen it go a few ways 

1. Have a reasonably **** lowest common denominator ‘works for both’ setup (like a centrally managed templates pipeline that runs terraform and handles all creds etc. 

Nice if you provide for lots of teams that are fairly low skilled and instance based and can’t design their own pipelines and think about security.
Bad if you start getting lots of teams that want to explore serverless and use more cloud native or cloud specific deployment patterns, but also want consumable tooling (think CDK and whatever the azure version of that is). 
Now your ‘development of pipelines’ has more than doubled and your team is naturally balanced to be better at one cloud, offerings begin to diverge.

2. Have 2 platform teams, everything becomes ‘for that you need to ask ‘other team’. One of the teams is way shittier than the other team. Offerings start to diverge, things are looked at wildly differently by both teams.

3. Let’s just be a k8s house and do everything on k8s. Now you grumble about how ‘that clouds k8s sucks way more’ And when do you even really think the entire cloud will be down long enough to move it anyway.

I’m sure there are use cases for doing this well, but in general, most enterprises don’t or won’t need the extra level of complexity and cost to do this well and at their current spend can’t do it well enough to be worth it.",-1,0.0

Why aren't you getting into it? Do you want to? Do you have questions? Let's chat, let's compare notes, let's help each other.","I can't speak to IIS as I don't know how well that application aspect has been ""containerised"" so to say, so I'm going to describe roughly how this could be achieved with something like nginx/apache instead. This is conceptual, not exactly code you can copy/paste to immediately use. :P

So, there's an aspect like Nginx Ingress that will eventually be relevant (or other ingresses) to this topic, in that they behave as reverse-proxies, so heads-up on that. But it is not a REQUIREMENT for this to succeed, it just is frequently used, so that aspect is likely to be on your radar at some point.

For the sake of example let's assume your CI/CD pipeline ""just works"" and all that. I want to define a yaml file for hosting a website that's already written with nginx or apache. This is roughly the aspects I would define in the yaml file:

1. I would declare which container image I want to use (in this case, a docker image, probably served on docker hub, for apache or nginx). So in the yaml file I may need to declare the source, but sometimes docker hub is assumed so you may not need to declare the source (container repository is the term for where you can get container images). I would declare the name of the container image, and I may also explicitly declare the version (tag) I want, but this is an option, and not a requirement (generally). Sometimes you do not want to declare a version, sometimes you do.
2. I would then declare how the web content shows up within the container. Am I mounting an NFS/other share where the web files exist? Am I downloading the files each time into the container? Effectively defining how the files the web server (apache/nginx) serves gets into the container.
3. I may want to declare headers/configuration aspects I want apache/nginx to use, TLS version, which SSL cert to use/where to get it, stuff like that.
4. I may want to declare logging configuration, what I want logged, where it gets logged to (if I want it to be a different location), stuff like that.

Eventually once I've figured out all I want declared in the yaml file (sometimes it is only a few declarations, it doesn't have to be huge, it's up to you), I save it, the CI/CD pipeline executes it.

You can see some example yaml stuff here : https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/

I enjoy DevOps only as an add-on thing to my development skills. Like I learned about Gitlab's CI/CD pipeline and Docker and all those trending stuff so that I read about. 

You have been working as a DevOps person and that too at a senior level, so why don't you look at moving towards being a security consultant? I have seen that field is now something companies take very seriously. There is always new stuff coming up, so you will always have new challenges which will keep you interested.

All told, a year into it I realized that without a clear plan and commitment this company would never adopt the principles, because they simply could not get ahead of the fires starting from the misapplication of Jenkins, Puppet, and Vsphere. 

So I left this position with a wealth of valuable knowledge about how NOT to do software. I can't really say that I had a bad experience with DevOps itself, because this position ultimately had little to do with it.

That's about the gist of it. I spent a few years in app dev, while learning networking and sysadmin. I definitely spent a massive amount of my own personal time (and what money I had) experimenting with new things at home while building a home lab. After you set it up manually, and put the effort into understanding what and why something is configured in a certain manner, then you can go to work towards automating it. 

I definitely think having a home lab to build and make things work on various platforms contributed greatly to understanding how cloud infrastructure works. Every person I've met, or worked with directly had a passion for technology and a curiosity as to how things work. Enough that they spent at least a few hours a week working on expanding their own skill set.

I think a major issue now is that companies want a ""one-stop shop"" for anything and everything that's not solely software development. They have an expectation that they just need ""a couple of devops engineering, or an SRE to make the code run reliably"", so the developers just write code that works.... on their machine in visual studio...

The first and biggest challenge was ensuring a smooth migration, with minimal interruption to the workflow. We accomplished this by:

* Putting user accounts, identity tokens, single-sign-on, etc. in place before attempting the migration.
* Using a throwaway project as our test vehicle for every aspect of the migration.
* Doing it in a series of small steps, rather than one big step, and making sure each small step worked before taking the next step. This had the added benefit of only requiring us to undo the one small step if something went wrong.
* Setting up a parallel workflow in the cloud, and exercising it rigorously, before committing any one of those previously-mentioned small steps to the cloud.
* Leaving the on-prem toolchain intact, but idle, for a period of time until the cloud-based toolchain was 100% implemented and proven. We could have decommissioned the on-prem toolchain after 3 to 6 weeks, but we waited 3 months just to play it safe.
* I should probably put this first, but before we started anything, we ensured that we had 100% commitment and financial support from the executive suite, and 100% buy-in and guidance and support from the IT gang. We did not go into this in a half-assed fashion.",-1,0.0

Let them ask for what they want, agree on objectives and time lines, other deliverables. When they ask for extra things ask what they are willing to give up.


The other problem is you, you've got 10-15 years of experience working with in infrastructure, deployments, running systems and keeping the lights on, you've built resilient systems and know what it takes to make a resilient agile environment to get the most out of your cloud spending and devs. Most other people don't and they just want **** that's been polished, just a touch. Being told they are wrong and they are running absolute shitshows just **** people off. You need to be very incremental in how you approach. Working with polished pieces of **** really sucks, especially when you know how to do it better and could fix in a couple of weeks to move a delivery forward 6-18 months and make everyone's life a lot easier. This is your problem (and mine), we have to choose our battles, help where we can, try to hold back and not say I told you so and hopefully get on a greenfield project where we can do everything right from the get go.


I'm starting to realise a lot of people snowflakes too and cannot take any critical feedback :( They've been micromanaged most of their lives, haven't had much autonomy and don't know how to receive feedback.. it's kinda sad. When you come in with your years of experience, know how of best practices and point out the system/architecture/process flaws they feel _very threatened_ (I would love some with more experience, a different perspective to do this to my work). Putting your knowledge forward and getting excited about fixing things is _very bad_, you'll typically get reprimanded for this (twice so far for me, different organisations). Again, this is your problem, you didn't pick the right job with the right culture for you. I've grown up around some incredibly smart engineers over the years and I've really respected the time they've taken to mentor and help me, I've been given a lot of feedback, had perspectives changed and now crave it.. these other organisations/managers/teams won't give it to you, they just want to make sure everyone is doing ok and we are meeting deadlines........ innovations and improvements just in the way.


I'm now looking for the right team and right culture.. it's a hard search but the opportunity cost for me for the next 10 years is too high so I'm holding off for the right role. In ten years, I'll be good to sit back, do my work, make my manager happy and not try to fix things while just taking a paycheck until I have enough to retire... I can't do that now... I'm hoping I can in the future, because you can make some pretty good money in these roles and those orgs are always desperate for people.",8,0.8171167367352146

We have a hardware team that owns hardware. They make sure that a defined in SLA %% of hardware boxes are up and running for every team at any given point in time. The customer teams need to understand that %% is not 100 explicitly, and make sure that their apps can survive a defined %% of their boxes to be down.

That team consists exclusively of developers. Their dev manager came from Office, the rest of the devs from other dev teams inside or outside Microsoft. In addition to being programmers, they acquired extra set of expertise in hardware - they know how to flush BIOS (programmatically!), determine that the disk is failing (programmatically!), and RMA the machines (programmatically!). 

They also are good at debugging hardware failures (by hand), and translating these failures for future (programmatic!) actions by the system. They participate in defining the hardware which vendors then build for us. When hardware tends to misbehave, these devs wake up and make sure that it behaves again.

We a have networking team that consists of devs who also understand the network. They are otherwise normal regular devs. Their dev manager came from Microsoft Research. They own the network architecture, configuring routers (programmatically!), monitoring the network health (programmatically!), RMA the dead hardware (programmatically!), etc.

They are also good at debugging network failures (by hand), and translating these failures for future (programmatic!) actions by the system. They select network hardware that we buy. When network misbehaves, these devs wake up and make sure that it behaves again.

We have a system team. I am the dev manager for that team. I used to work on operating systems (NT, Windows CE), and cloud apps (Gmail, Google Voice, Google Maps). We have a bunch of regular normal devs that came all over MSFT, and outside. Our software sits on top of network and hardware. When it misbehaves, we (senior members of the team, including, until 2 months ago, myself) wake up. We'd debug the problem. Most of the time we would isolate the problem to our own software, and fix it. Sometimes we would isolate it to hardware or network. If hardware or network is in fact below SLA (losing 1 server IS NOT), we would wake up devs on these two teams. If hardware or network is within SLA, but our s/w cannot tolerate loss of hardware or %% of network capacity, we would fix our software.

We have customers (Bing, Xbox). They are normal regular devs who write cloud apps. When their app misbehaves, they wake up. They typically isolate the problem to their own s/w, and fix it. Sometimes, it isolates to loss of hardware capacity, network capacity, or Autopilot system services. Then they wake up us (including myself, the dev mgrs. for network or hardware - whoever happens to be on call). The very first thing we look at if whether our service is in fact under SLA. Again, losing a few servers our of a hundred is not. Losing a switch is not. If we are not violating SLA, we'd berate them for waking us up, tell them to fix their own software, and go right back to sleep.

And so it goes.

Notice that in this model
1) everyone is debugging their own code, and
2) some DEV = network expert, some DEV = hardware expert, and we discourage (prohibit!) any database uses that might require a DBA.

cons of Devops:

* on-call. Depending on the job this could vary from no on-call at all to long periods of on-call nights and weekends. Software engineers can have this too, but it's more common with devops.
* A lot of yaml configuration. Instead of being able to use the debugger to go through step-by-step, you have to pour through documentation to find some fiddly little detail you missed. 
* Constant reuse and configuration of existing tools doesn't give you the pride of writing your own logic. Sometimes you don't want to connect the Lego pieces together, you want to make the pieces themselves.

pros:

* reusing existing tools allow you to achieve satisfying results much quicker than writing stuff from scratch
* A lot of diversity, like you mentioned
* It can feel more impactful than software engineering. You have a broader scope. You might be making changes that impact the entire company rather than just adding a single feature to a single page of the product. Although a good feature could be important to the company as well.",-1,0.0

I'd rather it be a flat 20%.  For the years when I had **** employer coverage ($500/mo, $8000 deductible, 50% coverage), I just didn't go to the doctor at all.  Ended up with ribs that didn't heal correctly after being broken;  not seeing doctor for broken ankle.  Not seeing doctor after an animal bite (possum).   Hoping that a regular vomiting and violent rib/torso pain would go away -- until I had insurance that would cover it.   At the time, it was ""a preexisting condition"" and insurance wouldn't cover treating it at all.  At least the law changed around 12 years ago, making denying ""preexisting conditions"" illegal.

Not seeing a doctor for 10 \~ 15 years, because of not making enough money to make use of medical insurance, followed by earning enough to do so -- I'd rather the flat 20% approach, even now when making 200k+.  Take that 40k and let me not worry about the costs of every little item, every little visit.  It would have been nice to see a doctor when I was unemployed, or working retail, or in the first 8 years of my career, when making $65k is not enough to actually see a doctor.",7,0.6858913230737653

(What pipeline tools do you use?),"Well, since I don't see a good clear answer I think I'll dive in... and I'll do it as simply as possible.  With key points...

* Jenkins was (arguably) an decent tool, when it was the only fish in the sea.
* The web GUI for Jenkins, compared to basically any other CI/CD tool out there really makes you want to pull your hair out.  Configuration, especially of plugins, but even of your pipelines is very difficult.  You practically need a degree in using Jenkins to be effective at it.
* Jenkins used to only be configurable via their web GUI, and the CI/CD world around started using an in-codebase lingo and that was universally accepted as best/better practice so you could ""version"" your CI/CD with your code.  Jenkins tried to help fill this with ""Pipeline/Configuration as Code"" feature(s).  This attempt was abysmal.
* When Jenkins defined-as-code, please compare the (arguably insane) syntax necessary for Jenkinsfiles compared to basically ANY other tool in the industry.  It makes me want to claw my hair out.  This was likely engineered this way to support the internals of how Jenkins logic worked.  You have to basically ""know"" Jenkins in and out to engineer their pipelines as code effectively.  Their language doesn't support ""object-oriented"" anything, doesn't leverage re-use or building blocks/standards to implement at a company.
* Their plugin architecture is absolutely insane.  Hard to manage, maintain, and support.  Very difficult (or impossible) to update/upgrade Jenkins for fear of breaking things.  You basically install Jenkins and never upgrade, ever.
* Jenkins is ""heavy"" (as are most any Java-based tools out there).  This requires an excess of RAM and CPU just to host and run Jenkins.
* In my experience, folks who are still setting up Jenkins servers, have never used another CI/CD tool in their life.  This industry has a lot of people that are afraid of change and tend to like to learn one thing and try to do that one thing forever.  This is a HUGE flaw in our industry, as antiquated tools and technologies tend to forever haunt us.  (Arguably, the flip-side of fear-of-change is folks that want to always be bleeding edge, which I am also highly-against)
* EVERY time I've shown someone an well engineered Gitlab CI, or Github Actions, or Circle CI setup, I've converted teams instantly to those tools.  In modern CI/CD tools, they have built-in features like Environments, with automated integrations available for most to automatically delete old (eg: dynamic) dev environments.  An nice GUI available for any of them to view all the different environments you've deployed your code to, and an easy single-button interface to rollback to a previous version.
* Jenkins doesn't ""host"" anything, and doesn't have a cloud offering (afaik?).  So, this is where I really lean on how great it is for your SCM provider to ALSO be your CI/CD provider.  Github + Github Actions, Gitlab + Gitlab CI, etc.  The tight integration and security model around an SCM provider and their own CI tool is unparalleled compared to having to use and manage two tools.
* I personally do not accept jobs that use Jenkins that won't let me help them switch off it.  This is, by far, the worst CI/CD tool in this industry that I hope dies in a fire.  There is no amount of money (not even millions of dollars) that would get me to work in a role where I had to build and support Jenkins.

It seems you don't get that term's meanings can change. Welcome to the future, here DevOps stopped being something mentioned by manager books of 2013 and is now an actual thing used by thousands of tech companies.

> and getting in the way of progress

How?

> I think it's time for it to die.

And then proceeds to defend the ""original"" meaning of the term. How is it wanting it to die?

> We know DevOps is not a role. But of course there are thousands of roles with ""DevOps"" in the title. 

No, we don't. I **know** it's a role, I can check it in my own job description, it says it right there ""DevOps Engineer"". It seems you are wrong, DevOps is a role.

> We know DevOps is not one thing you ""do"". But people are constantly asking - or telling - how they ""Do DevOps"" or ""Get Into DevOps"" or ""Become A DevOps"".

Again, we don't. If so many people claim to be doing DevOps, have you considered that **maybe** it is you the one who isn't doing DevOps?

> They all think the word means somebody who writes Terraform and gate-keeps the AWS IAM Administrator role. Common use of the term implies it means ""setting up server software in Linux"".

That's like saying that people think that ""Developer"" means someone who writes Python and reviews merge requests. Is being a Developer equivalent to writing Python and reviewing merge requests? No. Can writing Python and reviewing merge requests be specific tasks performed by someone that fills the role of a ""Developer""? Of course it can, same goes for writing Terraform and gate-keeping AWS IAM Admin roles for a ""DevOps"" role.

> Add in a few buzzwords like IaC and Immutable Infrastructure, and that's all there is to it.

It seems you also don't know what the term ""buzzword"" is if you think IaC or Immutable Infrastructure are ""buzzwords"". What are other ""buzzwords""? JavaScript? AWS? Git?

> It is so completely misunderstood by 99.99% of people that almost nobody uses it in the proper context

At what point does a word stop being ""misunderstood"" by the majority that understands A and starts being misunderstood by the minority that understands B? Pretty sure it is considerably below 99.99%. ""Gay"" used to mean ""happy"" 70 years ago and now 99.99% will understand first ""homosexual"". Is the 0.01% wrong? Not necessarily but if they are talking with anyone in the other 99.99% of the people and use the term ""gay"" and understand ""happy"" they likely are.

> The only people that do are the tiny, tiny few that have actually read all the books and blog posts and gone to the conferences

Ah yes, the actual people with the highest authority to say what a tech term means: people whose work is writing books and blogs.

If 9999 actual engineers say that DevOps is writing Terraform and 1 blogger says it's shortening the lifecycle and whatnot, then I'm sorry but in the tech industry DevOps means writing Terraform.

> Of course, a select few know DevOps' real definition

Ah yes, a select few who can Google ""DevOps"" and enter the first link. That's a really select group I wish I was part of... oh wait, I was part of that group before I even worked in tech...

> Unless you are a consultant working on Digital Transformation, you won't learn what DevOps actually encompasses, and probably will never work on all aspects of it as an IC.

What even entails being ""a consultant working on Digital Transformation""? Is a developer writing a test case working in digital transformation (assuming there wasn't a test case before)? You are just replacing a vague term with another vague term.

> This perpetually-misunderstood nonsense word will continue to be a blight on the practices it is intended to push

How is this ""a blight""? Who suffers from it? Noisy gate-keeping blogging experts? I'm a DevOps engineer and I don't suffer from this ""blight"", I even profit from it, I got from a position mostly writing Terraform templates to a position managing pipelines (with a nice pay rise in between) thanks to both being ""DevOps"" roles.

> We need to **** the term, so that new terms that speak to more specific aspects of DevOps can arise. Then it will be easier for people to be aware of them, learn how they work, and try to implement them.

How do you propose to **** the term? What do we win from it? You think people won't start using your new DevOps term for what DevOps means today?

> We need to remove the DevOps role and replace it with multiple bodies of knowledge aimed at different existing tech roles.

How do you propose to remove the role? Will you convince the thousands of companies that use the term for their roles?

> We also need to avoid roles that merely gatekeep access to production services/accounts, and focus on building the platforms that enable multiple roles to achieve system-level functionality without becoming systems experts.

No, we don't. Gatekeeping is a useful thing in some contexts, managing systems is one of them as it allows some users that lack the knowledge, trust or diligence to work on them without the ability to disrupt them in any significant way. From this sentence alone I'm convinced this rant was sparked because someone denied you a request for an admin access in your work AWS account.

> We need to remove the cargo-cult aspects of DevOps buzzwords and develop real engineering disciplines based on DevOps practices

Yes, that's exactly what already happened and you are complaining about. A blogger came and said ""DevOps is shortening lifecycles"" to an actual engineer, the engineer found out that using GitLab CI shortened the lifecycles so to him writing GitLab pipelines is ""doing DevOps"" and now you are complaining that the engineer removed his cargo-cult about the term.

> We need to show teams real world examples of DevOps culture that achieve both trust and excellence in the production and operation of software systems.

Internet is full of them. Guess what the real world examples are? Writing Terraform and gate keeping AWS roles.

> We need a manifesto (akin to the 12 Factor App) with a set of rules for how to adopt DevOps into a team and design a system with it in mind.

They already exist in your myriad of blogs, books and conferences. Nobody gives a **** because they are either worthless or too vague and apply to everything that is already DevOps.

> We've gotta stop calling it DevOps first, though... so we need new ways to refer to those specific components of DevOps without using the word ""DevOps"".

You haven't addressed a single reason to do any of that beyond you not liking people referring to DevOps as a role. What do we achieve with that? What problems do we avoid?

DevOps fosters collaboration and communication between developers and the operations team throughout the Development lifecycle. The partnership between development and operations teams leads to streamlined integration and helps them work together towards a common goal, resulting in a faster, efficient and reliable delivery system.
Although DevOps aims to create automation and integration, its real-world implementation can be difficult. Let’s look at five common challenges in DevOps adoption;
Moving from traditional infrastructure to microservice
If an organization uses an older infrastructure, it may face stability problems and a lack of support. Adopting a microservice architecture can benefit an organization with faster development and innovation.
However, there are a few challenges that come with implementing microservices. To make the transition successful, organizations should have configuration management, automation and continuous delivery. This will help them manage the increased operational workloads that come with microservices.
Resistance to change
Telling people they need to change can sometimes be difficult, but it’s important to remember that a DevOps transformation doesn’t happen overnight. It must be smooth and gradual so that everyone has time to get used to the new culture and learn different ways they can contribute to the development process. This allows for a successful transition for everyone involved.
Lack of common understanding of continuous delivery practices
Once you and your team have decided that code needs to be continuously delivered to reduce feedback loops and have implemented pipelines. But first, you need to make sure if your teams understand what it means to continuously deliver software into your environments. Most organizations will have their definition of continuous delivery, so it’s important that everyone is on the same page regarding its implementation.
Adoption of new tools
Adopting DevOps means that your teams must select various tools for development, testing and deployment and ensure that they all work together seamlessly. This can be a challenge, but it's worth it to harness the full potential of DevOps.
The selection process of these tools could spell out a huge challenge, as they must meet security requirements and be easy to integrate with your infrastructure. Besides, you need to train everyone on the new tools, so productivity is not compromised.
Too much focus on tools
With the benefits that DevOps promises, it's easy to get caught up in the shiny new tools it offers. However, it’s important to remember that with new tools comes the need to train your staff on how to use them effectively.
Furthermore, you must also consider security risks and whether or not the new tools will integrate well with your current infrastructure. All of this can quickly take your focus away from what’s most important: your team.
Even though this list comes from the team’s hands-on experience with numerous clients, we understand that not every method works for everyone. The DevOps adoption strategy will differ from organization to organization based on various factors. That’s why it’s a good idea to have a professional help guide you through the DevOps adoption process. You can check our services and contact us for more information.",0,1.0

This represents a _huge_ amount of work being abstracted away.But every week we have to have another discussion about pulling in the database-of-the-week or language-of-the-week because apparently we were completely unable to develop basic CRUD apps until the new hottest crypto-document-as-a-service-database came along to let us store and retrieve data.And every time they think _their_ application deserves special snowflake status. We're just making things difficult, they could fire up a VM and have this set up in 15 minutes.This completely fails to account for _most_ of the actual work involved in setting most production systems up properly. How is this being kept updated and patched? Where are the backups? Where's the monitoring? What's the disaster recovery plan? Where's the documentation? Never mind trying to integrate it into all of our existing systems (making sure it's on the appropriate subnet, has appropriately configured security groups, etc, etc).This also completely fails to account for the long tail: Even if you reimplement all of this, now it _all_ needs to be maintained for the life of your application. Any time we need to make major infrastructure-level changes, we need to account for n+1 different systems that need to be updated. If we need to do any migrations, we need to migrate n+1 things. If you need functionality X, we can't re-use the existing battle-tested modular templates to provide it to you it has to be implemented from scratch (and also maintained indefinitely).Most devs I've worked with aren't well-versed enough in ops to understand the full immediate scope nor the long tail. They only see the project as far as, and only plan to see it through as far as, get it working and shitfix as required.To your dashboard example... it's for 10 people, but that doesn't change the underlying equation for most of these things. The fact that only 10 people use it will not stop it being turned into a jumpbox for some hacker group or getting our external IPs blackholed after it sends a bunch of spam because nobody bothered to patch the OS for five years. The fact that it's only for 10 people doesn't mean it's not business critical and could be down indefinitely. The fact that it's only for 10 people doesn't mean we shouldn't have a local/staging environment and should be working in prod. The fact that it's only for 10 people doesn't mean it doesn't need to integrate into any other systems (where is it sourcing data? how is it authenticating users? how is it authenticating itself to other systems?). The fact that it's only for 10 people doesn't mean someone doesn't have to maintain it after you're gone.Following the standard _should_ be the happy path so that you don't have to worry about all this stuff.

I'd suggest a 2-pronged attack:  
1. Deal with everything that's important and urgent, immediately (no git? fix it!)  
2. Get the teams involved, as much as possible, with changes that you're bringing in.  

The reasoning behind number 2 is that in order for change to be effective, it has to be adopted, and sticky. One of the more common ways that managers alienate staff is to make good changes unilaterally. They often don't realize that the process of change, and the inclusion of people in the process is necessary for successful adoption.
All the major systems thinkers include consultation of staff (Deming, Goldratt, Seddon, etc) for this reason.  

A large part of your work is going to be to get the teams that now answer to you to think about who their customers are, how they can serve them, and what they're doing now that gets in the way. This is likely to be a major change, and will take time. But keep at it, and it'll improve.

It just means they’re earning less than 80% of the median in their area (most people nearby are earning quite a bit more money than you). In other words, a high “low-income” figure just means that most people in that area have very high incomes in general. But anyway, a “standard family” is a family of 4 per Santa Clara county definition (assumed to be 2 adults with 2 children). Given that 40% of the county is foreign-born and the typical household consists only of 2.89 people (likely more couples + one child and a few childless couples), family costs are likely lower than whatever they’re reporting for the “standard family” they have in mind. This is per the [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/santaclaracountycalifornia,CA/PST045223). Also, your comment implies generalizations about cost of living in America based on one of the highest-income counties in the entire country (median family income of >$180k for that “standard family” last year). Of course their standard for what counts as “low income” is gonna be much higher than the rest of the country. Plus, the tech companies are not providing those campus perks to avoid “paying up,” as you claimed. They’re the entire reason that incomes are sky high in Santa Clara county, and largely responsible for the county stating that income below $96k is low for a single person. 

And on that point: I’m not sure where you found those lofty numbers, but I certainly couldn’t find them when I searched. Instead I found this from the [San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/low-income-median-levels-18164328.php#):

>“Santa Clara County’s median income for a four-person household is $181,300. A four-person household there making $137,100 or less is considered low income.

>For a single person in Santa Clara County, the low-income maximum is $96,000.”

Nowhere could I find any source that published numbers approaching the numbers you’re pushing here as “low-income” for Santa Clara county. Per the [document](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/income-limits-2023.pdf) cited by the article, a family of 8 would be considered “low-income” if their income was less than $181k in Santa Clara county, which is still less than the lower limit you’re reporting for a household that’s half the size. And that’s on a scale of “Acutely low Income,” “Extremely Low Income,” “Very Low Income,” “Median Income,” and “Moderate Income.” There’s literally no reason to lie or grotesquely exaggerate the situation to make the point you’re trying to make. Please don’t push misinformation just to make a point online.",4,0.7626800645446955

I understood everything from IPtables, SELinux, Docker, etcd, basically the whole stack before they stuck it all together and called it Kubernetes.

An example would be a pod, its just SELinux and Chroot, with some iptables thrown in.

Or a volume its just a mount into the chrooted environment.

So you can learn the individual parts and build up which is probably way too much effort. Or you can learn  the Kubernetes abstraction layer on top of all this technology. Then when it turns to custard you can ring the support team to fix it.

BTW All the parts a very easy to learn, the problem is there are lots of them and layers on top. Which really is how IT works for basically everything, so welcome to the puddle of mud (cake).",6,1.0

Being a freelance consultant, I see a lot of this ****. I've dealt twice now with an absolute gitops nightmare, and both times this was the main cause. Maybe it's fine if you're dealing with a few dozen services, but beyond that it simply does not scale.

If you run a limited setup and have maybe 2 dozen services or so, you could manage them all in a single gitops repo - and yes, working with branching there would probably become a pain. But beyond that it quickly becomes a PR and merge conflict nightmare. At some point some genius will add common helm or whatever code in the repo itself, which all a lot of deploys then blindly start using (and no versioning, since `main` rules the world). Inevitably, at some point, someone breaks the common code, and if you're lucky - that common code has a copy per environment, and only breaks everything there. But what's the point of common code if you can't use it to break all environments at the same time?",-1,0.0

So if a CI/CD pipeline calls an async task that actually updates the system, that makes it GitOps? That doesn't seem right. I think the distinction is whether CI/CD (push) or a process integrated into your target platform (pull) causes the update.

Requiring the desired output be expressed declaratively is merely IaC.

CI/CD is a hat on top of your VCS. Reconciliation is a hat on top of your platform's execution environment that's aware of your VCS state via polling. If your platform is offline when CI/CD runs, it should pick up where it's supposed to when it comes online.

CI/CD where the final phase is completed asynchronously, out of band of the actual CI/CD pipeline, might yield similar patterns for the operator (the human, not like a k8s operator), but I think it's fundamentally different than GitOps, which technically doesn't need any CI/CD job be configured at all if you're writing your configurations by hand. Sure, a standard tool like k8s/argo is not a literal hard requirement, and I definitely have seen some simple lamp stack systems go from developer-runs-rsync-while-praying to daemon-running-inside-target-platform-git-pulls-regularly-and-runs-hook-on-change, and the latter probably technically counts as GitOps, but only technically and doesn't do enough for you for it to really be a shiny pattern to flock to.

Say I'm using pulumi. I have my CI/CD pipeline end with computing the preview, commenting that on the PR, and once a maintainer says ""/deploy"" in response to that comment, a job merges the PR and tees off another deploy job, writing any errors back to the original PR. That is 100% not GitOps, but it seems to fit your original description. It's also 100% better than the crappy git polling daemon I described at the end of the last paragraph, even though that would be kinda-sorta-technically GitOps",3,0.4335364788034193

1. There was a lot of manual work to configure and setup a build environment and at the time no reliable options to keep build configs with the source code.

2. Builds did not happen in a clean isolated environment. I suspect this is now solved with by using docker.

3. Plugins had various levels of reliability and we relied on a number of them to get the functionality we needed. 

4. He had to manage updates for Jenkins and the plugins, and those updates broke our setup at times which meant we avoided updating certain plugins because of major functionality change or a dev on the team took the time to understand the changes and update Jenkins and each individual build (between 20-30) . 

I believe the first and second points are non issues these days, but I'm not sure if that's the case out of the box or if you need to use certain plugins.

Let's pick a few things: 

1. DevOps is a different role than QA and Dev. Its purpose is to facilitate both of those groups, and to remove the barrier that IT/Ops has traditionally thrown up. It's got a different skill set, with different goals. 
2. If you claim to be a developer, and don't know SQL or the basics of testing, I'm not going to hire you. You can fight it all you want, but that's the current industry, and there is no shortage of people who have those skills. 
3. Full-stack developers are not that uncommon. I am one. I could function in ANY of those jobs you listed. I'll code up some angular directives in the morning, then move into the java REST layer for the afternoon. The question isn't why -- it's why NOT? This is the first sign of falling behind the times. You should have some passing knowledge of making a webapp if you claim to be a webapp developer. If you want to stick with server-side-only, that's fine, but your job hunt will be longer. 
4. ""If there's a particularly nasty issue that seems to require deep database knowledge, you don't have the liberty of saying ""that's not my specialty,"" and handing it off to a DBA team to investigate.""  -- You're right. As a developer, you NEVER have that right or ability. You need to google around. You need to try some stuff. You need to look at docs. If you throw your hands up every time you run into an issue, you're not going to last long. Yes, sometimes it's out of your area of expertise, but that's no excuse. Everything is out of your expertise until it's not. 
5. ""Developer is at the top, followed by sysadmin and DBA. QA teams, ""operations"" people, release coordinators and the like are at the bottom of the totem pole."" -- Here we go. You're doing it, I've seen it a thousand times. It's the ""I'm a programmer, so I'm super special and super smart and everybody else is below me."" It's no surprise you put Developer at the top of the totem pole. You're not that important, and you're not that singular in importance. Developers can't do a good QA job if your company is segmenting those roles. Most QA and Dev don't have root privileges. This isn't a totem pole.

* Install and configure application
* Administer database

1. Overcoming the Dev versus Ops mentality
The DevOps practice is all about integrating teams together and breaking down silos within IT organizations.
2. Moving from legacy infrastructure to microservices
Older infrastructure and applications can be problematic, even if it has served the company for years. Remaining on legacy infrastructure can spell stability problems, lack of support, and the fact that you will be left behind the swiftly advancing competition.
3. Too much focus on tools
With the exciting prospect of adopting DevOps, the flashy new tools in the market can seem like they solve every problem under the sun. However, with the introduction of new tools, you also need to train staff to use them, ensure they meet security requirements, and of course, make sure that the tools are well-integrated with the existing infrastructure.
4. Resistance to change
The move to DevOps can seem scary to a majority of team members and key stakeholders.

Seriously, I was curious about those ""full-stack"" positions, I thought they were full tech stack (app to assembly), or full TCP/IP stack or something...

There's a bigger trend at work here: as we get better libraries, there's more library interfacing and less coding. Already, a lot of Java or Python coding is wiring libraries together, and finding/evaluating/integrating 3rd party libraries for needed functionality. There's quite a few ""mash-ups"" between web-services.

This is the ancient prophecy of `code reuse`, come true in our time.

Of course, there'll always be a need for some new code, it's just a different balance point, as we slowly build up all the libraries needed.

Here are the biggest challenges and ways to overcome them:
1. Cultural Resistance to Change
🚧 Challenge: Teams (especially development and operations) may resist change due to fear of losing control, job security concerns, or lack of understanding of DevOps principles.
✅ Solution:
Promote a collaborative culture with open communication.
Provide training and workshops to help teams understand DevOps benefits.
Start with small wins to showcase DevOps success and build confidence.
2. Lack of Skilled Personnel
🚧 Challenge: DevOps requires expertise in automation, cloud, CI/CD, and monitoring, which many organizations lack.
✅ Solution:
Invest in upskilling employees through courses and certifications (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes).
Hire experienced DevOps engineers or consultants to guide the transition.
Encourage cross-functional training so developers and operations teams can learn from each other.
3. Siloed Teams and Poor Collaboration
🚧 Challenge: Traditional IT structures have separate teams for development, operations, security, and QA, leading to inefficiencies.
✅ Solution:
Break down silos by fostering cross-functional teams that collaborate throughout the software lifecycle.
Implement shared goals and KPIs to align all teams.
Use collaboration tools like Slack, Jira, or Confluence to improve communication.
4. Legacy Systems and Infrastructure
🚧 Challenge: Many organizations still rely on outdated infrastructure that isn't compatible with modern DevOps practices.
✅ Solution:
Adopt a hybrid approach, gradually modernizing legacy systems instead of replacing them all at once.
Use containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) to bridge the gap between old and new systems.
Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Terraform or Ansible.
5. Security and Compliance Issues
🚧 Challenge: Integrating security into DevOps (DevSecOps) can be difficult, especially for industries with strict regulations.
✅ Solution:
Embed security practices early in the DevOps pipeline (Shift Left Security).
Automate security scanning and compliance checks using tools like SonarQube or Snyk.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and secure secrets management.
6. Tool Overload and Complexity
🚧 Challenge: Too many tools can create confusion, integration issues, and inefficiencies.
✅ Solution:
Standardize the DevOps toolchain with carefully selected tools.
Use all-in-one DevOps platforms like GitLab CI/CD or Azure DevOps to reduce complexity.
Regularly review and optimize tool usage to avoid unnecessary complexity.
7. Measuring DevOps Success
🚧 Challenge: Many organizations struggle to track the impact of DevOps transformation.
✅ Solution:
Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as:Deployment frequencyLead time for changesMean Time to Recovery (MTTR)Change failure rate
Use monitoring and analytics tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack to track progress.
Conclusion
DevOps adoption is a journey, not a one-time project. Organizations must focus on culture, skill development, collaboration, modernization, security, tool selection, and measurement to succeed.

Even though it shouldn't be. Companies hire high-performing (or sometimes not-so-high) sysadmins and expect them to be able to IaC everything and write code. Actual developers want to be paid SDE money. Some places see DevOps as sysadmin+ and some see it as on par with SDE or even SDE+ (like a specialization). So the ranges vary really widely.

Also the work itself for many (not me, but many) is tedious. They want to (or think they want to) do ""real"" development work like adding div tags.

As someone who enjoys actual challenging ops work, I myself struggle with this. Staying in a ""devops"" job too long at the wrong place means being sysadmin+ and that's a step backwards for my career. It is seen as a support role and inferior. It puts you in a different bracket in salary, social structure, etc at work compared to ""real"" developers.

Seriously, idk why people can't acknowledge this absolute fact about this type of work. As long as the industry keeps making this the sysadmin+ role, it will always be this way.

The job, as I understand it, is **information systems engineer**. As an information systems engineer, the job objective is to produce a system which supports information flows between a number of appropriate clients, while minimizing error.

The job, whether it is 'more on the developer side' or 'more on the operations side' is to support this objective; as a valued component of a team that is (maybe should) always operating with relatively constrained resources.

I don't know how the article could suggest that operational process control and change control are at all preventing developers from coding.

""I can't get anything done because I've suddenly realized how much work it is to realistically run my own PaaS on an IaaS with my standby 'install.sh'"" is not a valid argument.

It makes perfect sense to minimize error. Developers should be concerned with scale. Systems should be concerned with which applications they are putting in the cloud.

I routinely argue for holism in science fields to counteract specialization entropy. The fields intersect; that is where inefficient communication and handoffs happen.",-1,0.0

It doesn't require plugins for everything. If anything, power users recommend to use as few plugins as possible for your Jenkins instance and rely on the Jenkisnfiles and proper pipelines to achieve CICD.

But in case we are concious beings, we can control it. We can choose the least complex solution instead of the promised perfect heaven. We can write a thin layer of abstraction instead of trying to generalize everything. We can shape our solutions based on real demand instead of believing the CEO bs that tomorrow we gonna need to scale to 1 million users, while the startup just got 3 employees and half of them are working part-time. No, you don‘t always need a hyperscaler, now do you always need Kubernetes, distributed systems and enterprise-grade solutions for every single piece of infrastructure, including the glue between with bells and whistles.

What you truly need is true understanding of computer science and reality. People have forgotten how powerful their hardware became, how protocols work, how kernels work, etc. They only learn how to type a few commands, wire up and use highly complex applications and services they often even don‘t own and therefore have to obey to every change. 

In fact, you can nowadays buy two dedicated servers e.g at Hetzner, each 50$/m with backup storage, put application code in containers, let them run individually on those hosts, and serve 500k users/month easily with most workloads.. oh and if one server fails? Then you setup the second one without outage. And if files go corrupt, you tested your backup. Oh and if the whole region is down??? Yeah, then it is down. So what. When was the region down the last time? How would it affect the business of your company? In contrast to spending 1000x on infrastructure every month? People are getting to alarmed about what they need too. You can run a whole business on 100$/m rented hardware with very low complexity and better availability/failsafety than you could with 10k/m about 15 years ago, when we used to deploy code manually on weak servers bare metal in the basement of the company building.

It is a large topic, and I can empathise with being uncertain what to do, and how. Perhaps I can help give you direction.

1. I recommend you [read this first](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/t4btu9/i_am_****_company_sold_out_5_months_into_my/hyxywqt/), namely because a lot of it is already covered by my comment there. Plus the book I mention is worth reading as it can give you a lot of ""aha"" moments.
2. In terms of what to do/how to get started, this can be dictated by the goals you/your org have. I generally advocate operating a homelab for may reasons, and running your own homelab is a great way to build DevOps in ways that can work for you, and you can make tangible what it can look like. Plus by trying things out you can see what does and does not work for your goals, or even at times inspire you to clarify what your goals are through exposure.
3. DevOps does rely on technology, but it is not necessarily married to specific technology, more certain capabilities that technology can perform. So docker is relevant, but not the only way to go. But it is worth expanding upon. I would say that instead of necessarily thinking strictly at the docker container regard, put your efforts into learning kubernetes/k8s which expands upon (and uses) docker containers. If you want a menu to pick a bunch of container images from [check this one out](https://fleet.linuxserver.io/), it is not the only source of good docker images, but I think it would be helpful for you.
4. Additionally, perhaps expand on what tools you're using, and how. For k8s, I would recommend working with Rancher to help you manage k8s clusters, and this can help you get up and running quickly. In addition to that, work towards having a gitlab self-hosted repo (for the code for IaC/Infrastructure As Code), as well as having argo-cd connect your repo(s) to your k8s clusters, so it starts becoming the automation glue for creading/editing/destroying/updating systems within k8s. I myself am a fan of Codium as an editor/IDE for writing the yaml.

Now, I can appreciate I just said a lot, and I'm going to add some more context. Plus, this is not the _ONLY_ way to do this, this is a successful way to do it that costs $0 as it is all open source.

Kubernetes/k8s builds on and uses docker containers. It adds features such as how many docker containers work together, automatically spinup/down across nodes (fault-tolerance/high-availability), improved security, and a whole lot of stuff that docker itself does not have out of the box. It is heavily used all over the place.

Yaml files are basic text files that have a specific syntax and are ""feature rich"" config files, so to say. In this case, they are used to define how you want systems/things to look, and if you want things to change how they look you edit the yaml file and save/commit to the repo.

The premise behind the particular tools I'm recommending is that it follows this rough flow, but this is not the only way, if you wanted to spin a new thing up:
1. You open your editor/IDE that is already set up to connect to your IaC repository.
2. You create a new yaml file, naming it something sensible, and write out all the aspects that define this new system/thing you want spun up. This could be a website, a database, a SIP/STUN/TURN phone system, a game server, or any other number of things. The sky is the limit.
3. Once you have written all you want, you save and commit the changes to the repo (and/or merge your branch, another topic another time).
4. The new yaml file now is in your repository (on your gitlab system) and you have nice version control stuff so you can roll back if you make mistakes, things like that.
5. argo-cd detects this new yaml file exists, check that it makes sense, and then interfaces with the relevant k8s cluster/namespace. argo-cd then begins applying this yaml file to create the necessary components that are defined in this yaml file.
6. Your new shiny thing becomes operational.

The amount of work at this point is roughly just writing a really good text file that describes what you want.

Now, as for your other aspects...

Linux itself is free, but for businesses there needs to be a number they can call at 3am in the morning and have an engineer be available on the other end; Support. That's why Redhat is so popular. Businesses can strike a deal with vendors like MS and Apple which gives them incentives on bundling various services together and in the long run actually reduce platform costs.

Furthermore, there are infrastructures like Active Directory which would be too tedious to unwrap and migrate to the fragmented solutions on Linux (ldap/radius whatever). Sometimes businesses run pilot programs where they migrate a unit to a new platform and see the practical costs of migrating to a new tech. They then have to migrate back when the pilot ends and the results aren't favorable.

There are also far more ""qualified"" people in MS tech than there are in *nix verse. 

There are also audits and other things you need to do to qualify for standards and insurances. Software that comes from random sources is not trusted. Each and every line must have a guarantor to back it up. This is why MS shared its source code with govt and other valuable customers.

Basically be an expert in a wide range of potentially complex technologies which most of the time isn’t possible.

DevOps isnt all that much different than the sys admin role the skillset and mindset needed to succeed is fairly similar, there is just more of a focus on automation.

Your job ad should state which technologies are important to you, naturally with a matching salary for the skills and experience you are looking for.

Its not possible for someone to be an expert at everything so you can only really check their ability to use logic and how they approach unfamiliar technology or scenarios.

Just having a bunch of trivia questions you think someone should know is going to have very limited success. 

For example I have fairly advanced networking knowledge (in terms of of troubleshooting and RCA’s) but if you ask me some academic questions around networking there is a pretty good chance I could struggle a bit.

My next step will be as devops as my main role. It comes natural when you are curious of the new technologies and trends in our corner of IT.

> The best DevOps roles are developer roles. When a manager or a company has an epiphany, and realize that ""for all of the tools I'm trying to bolt onto my architecture, it would be better just to have a infrastructure and tooling focused developer"". [...]

I did already have my excursion in the devops role in the past and left the company I was working on because it was becoming exactly like OP describes. In this one, the IT dept is not so central in the business in the eyes of the big bosses (but it is in reality, as for many other companies) and we get to basically manage ourselves. We discussed for a year more or less and decided which steps to take from an on-premises / no-tests / monolithic to a more modern approach. We then assigned ourselves the ""next iteration"" roles in which I'll be the main developer in charge of basically exploring and experimenting in the devops side of things. The difference is that the rest of the time will be anyway expected to (1) follow my directions in terms of changes in the way we write our products (2) follow up with me whenever there is a moment to share the knowledge so that it's not everything on my shoulder.

When the DevOps Engineer chats with the Data Scientist.","(DevOps here)

Sure. It's your job to write the code and my job to have it deployed properly to our infrastructure. But if said code is more than just a couple lines long and has many specific requirements (like specific versions of some obscure library) I expect you to document that somehow, not just send me a single .py file and expect me to deploy that as if our servers are running inside google collab.",-1,0.0

The aspect that seems to stress other people out greatly are incident responses. I hate it for the company, but I have the exact opposite feeling about it than others.

I've worked with some great incident managers, though, where a large group of people effectively become a single well-oiled machine solving a difficult problem. It feels like being in NASA space control (at least I imagine so) when something goes wrong, and the talent of everyone contributes to bringing the astronauts home safely.",-1,0.0
